**Awakening from a dream**

Wise and noble men once believed in the music of the spheres: wise and noble men still believe in the 'moral significance of existence'. But one day this music of the spheres too will no longer be audible to them! They will awaken and perceive that their ears had been dreaming.

**What is living?**

Living — that is to continually eliminate from ourselves what is about to die; Living — that is to be cruel and inexorable towards all that becomes weak and old in ourselves and not only in ourselves. Living — that means, therefore to be without piety toward the dying, the wretched and the old? To be continually a murderer? — And yet old Moses said: "Thou shalt not kill!"

**Poet and bird**

The phoenix showed the poet a scroll which was burning to ashes. 'Do not be dismayed!' it said, 'it is your work! It does not have the spirit of the age and even less the spirit of those who are against the age: consequently it must be burned. But this is a good sign. There are many kinds of daybreaks.'

**At the crossroads**

Disgusting! You want to be part of a system in which one must either be a wheel and nothing else, or get run over by the other wheels! In which it goes without saying that everyone is what he has been made by decree from above! In which the hunt for 'connections' is among the natural duties! In which no one feels insulted if a man is drawn to his attention with the words 'he could be of use to you some day'! In which one is not ashamed to visit somebody in order to obtain his recommendation! In which one has not the faintest idea how with this easy conformity to such customs one has designated oneself a common piece of nature's pottery which others may use and smash without feeling very much compunction about it; as if one said: 'there will never be a shortage of things like me: take me! Don't stand on ceremony!'

**145**

In comparing man and woman in general we can say that woman would not have the genius for finery if she did not have the instinct for the secondary role.

**On easing life**

One principal means to ease life is to idealize all its processes; but from painting one should be well aware what idealization means. The painter requires that the viewer not look too hard or too close; he forces him back to a certain distance to view from there; he is obliged to presuppose that a viewer is at a fixed distance from his picture; indeed, he must even assume an equally fixed amount of visual acuity in his viewer; he may on no account waver about such things. So anyone who wants to idealize his life must not desire to see it too closely, and must keep his sight back at a certain distance. Goethe, for example, knew this trick well.
