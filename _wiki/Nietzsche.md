**Awakening from a dream**

Wise and noble men once believed in the music of the spheres: wise and noble men still believe in the 'moral significance of existence'. But one day this music of the spheres too will no longer be audible to them! They will awaken and perceive that their ears had been dreaming.

*Daybreak, Book II, Aphorism # 100.*
