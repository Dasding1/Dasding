# 2024-04-12 Addendum (Telos)

Some people might argue that there have been "purepop" waves within K-pop in the past, and that what we're seeing is just another passing fad. Well, that's true and I don't rule it out. Even so, the new "pure" wave has something unique about it, especially in terms of its visual identity: new groups are visually distinctive, and there is also a greater tendency towards clean, direct, even minimalist visuals (they finally seem to have had enough of sensorial brutalism and saturated pastel colors). Really, just compare [Lovelyz 'Ah-Choo'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7qisJ_KuYI) with [NewJeans 'Cool With You'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsYSSVoQnP4).
