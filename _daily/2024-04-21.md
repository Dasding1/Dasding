People's conception of paradise is excessively narrow. Maybe because our ideas of it stem from ancient peasants. To them, paradise was an Edenic realm of eternal rest, a vibrant land filled with happiness. And while that's true, paradise isn't just about boundless joy. It's also the doorway to the endless potential of the human soul. It's the opportunity to become anything: a deity hurling thunderbolts, a tiger stalking the forest, a snake crawling through the bowels of a city, and beyond.

Viewing paradise solely as an idyllic life in the countryside is as uninspired as Nolan's 'Inception,' where characters are placed in a dream world only to shooting each other.
