# 2025-02-21

when ancestral tales withered into silence and every realm turned to frost

when the earth itself became a vast, immense tomb

and only the solitary figure remained in a shadowed nook, compelled to ponder and judge

and the Self became his sovereign moving homeland

a silent style crept across the world

and was met with an unwitting reverence wherever it shadowed mimicking eyes

met with shy awe not for what it unveils but for what it shrouds

men eyes' twisted inward, burrowing into the skull, 

glimpsing treasures and treacheries in shifting measures, 

cloaking one and the other in the starkness of black and white

because it stands to conceal

the suit is a disguise
