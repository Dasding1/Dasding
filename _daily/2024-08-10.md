The left fails at memetics because they always tries to convey their values clearly and accusingly. They never allow you to understand things indirectly, by yourself.

The right (sometimes) succeeds because it only suggests its values through the indirect and insinuating subterfuge of irony, a mechanism that, by its very nature, forces the interlocutor to momentarily assume the perspective that the context demands, even if it goes against their values. 

Repeated exposure to this same structure of "taking the enemy's point of view" soon settles into the subconscious, gradually reshaping the minds of its targets, who one day suddenly become more sympathetic to the "other side".

Leftists can't use this mechanism outside their inner circlejerks - they've become too alien and inaccessible to ordinary people, who therefore can't take their perspective. They're stuck at the top of the midwit bell curve.

Given these disparate conditions, it's not much of a stretch to say that all you need to monopolize the current discourse is someone talented with an irreverent, unapologetic voice, who downplays the enemy's concerns and weaknesses, mocks them - and makes many, many, many posts.
