Dale Carnegie once said that anger is the greatest fuel for eloquence — and if he didn't say it, then I'm saying it. We speak more quickly, with a nearly brutal sincerity, when we're at odds with our interlocutor. And truly, every argument should have a touch of spice, an element that provokes the opponent to strike back with force and momentum. Lacking that bite, every debate becomes lukewarm, devoid of vigor, boring. The times when enemies had their heads cut off for opinions have passed - and I'm not advocating their return - but today we live at the other extreme: Its all masonic mindset and false courtesy. You sit there and watch the gay show of two fags astroturfing their real feelings in a continuous *asinus asinum fricat*.

this forced politeness prevents the debate from being what it is at its best, I mean, blond angels weaponizing us—some sharper, some duller—to death. 

Imagine this. Two equally sharp minds face each other in a prolonged, exhaustive duel. All possible offenses have been exchanged; ego and pride have already surrendered to the weight of verbal thrashings. Here extremes of rhetoric and true touch each other; ideas shed their linguistic cloak and grow huge; their vessels fade into the shadows of their own flags, becoming mere puppets guided by hidden hands—possessed—fighting as if their very life were at stake (because, in essence, someones life is being defended). Every fiber of their bodies, head to toe, plunges into the cause; they discover subterfuges, arguments, tricks, scams, aspects, everything at a speed and volume far above normal. Feet lift off the ground in an exosomatic ecstasy and it's all Naruto x Sasuke Valley of the End vibes until *BOOOM* everything shatters. The dust of a great explosion settles: someone is flat on the ground. He made a mistake. But right when the magic of death seems to play about him, rhetoric emerge again as a savior, a mist maker, a shelter for the fallen. He is taken barely alive and  begins to live as a relentless militia on the margins and undergrounds of the enemy’s linguistic domain, never admitting defeat, continuously looking for insurgency. Hell yea that's what i (and God too) mean by debate.
