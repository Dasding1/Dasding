# Suits



![[Pasted image 20250221205545.png]]

The elite no longer enjoy the protection of sumptuary laws, and the idea of being copied the very next day by everyone and anyone is not an idea that appeals to them. Should that be the case, one would immediately have to find a replacement. In order to avoid this perpetual hunt for new materials and styles, they insist on the greatest discretion.

The modern, intelligent individual must wear a disguise for others. This mask is the designated form of clothing for all people. Individual ... clothing is only for people with limited intellectual capacity. They have the need to scream out to the world what they are and who they ultimately are.

The suit is a disguise. A young man can count himself rich when he has a brain in his head and a good suit in his closet.
