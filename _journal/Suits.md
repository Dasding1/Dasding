The elite no longer enjoy the protection of sumptuary laws, and the idea of being copied the very next day by everyone and anyone is not an idea that appeals to them. Should that be the case, one would immediately have to find a replacement. In order to avoid this perpetual hunt for new materials and styles, they insist on the greatest discretion.

and the suit is a disguise.
