#  2024-04: Telos

The *telos* of certain musical genres is to be re-signified by their regional variants. Take pop music, for instance. It's often underestimated, yet it's the only relevant musical genre that hasn't separated the non-auditory senses from music — it wants to move you from head to toe, engage all your senses, and fulfill music's most traditional purpose of "animating" raw matter. Now, K-pop, as it finds its own path, holds onto that Dionysian W-pop vibe while ditching, through a gradual distillation process, its subversive and malicious elements. It’s a subtle vibeshift from the dark caves of lustful bimbocore to the pure lowlands of innocent lolita fashion — and it is happening now, right before our eyes¹ {:.right-aside}<p>![[4732.png]]

Now, onto rap. I think rap is a genre characterized fundamentally by its anacoluthic, direct and (most of the time) aggressive structure + content. When rap crossed paths with Rio's narcofeudalism, it got a dose of spiritual upliftment thanks to the strong and invigorating addition of evangelical faith (unexpectedly found in Rio's favelas). Unlike K-pop, Brazilian rap (or trap, if you will) did not distill the negative elements of its source, but built on them: while the former by and large celebrates the singularity of will without recognizing any moral parameter other than the individual, Rio's rap locates this will to power on the horizontal plane — "The state doesn't benefit me, so I'll create my own" — without losing sight of the vertical plane:  
  
*“Today the world spun (spun)  
  
*The Lord be praised, the one who's changed my life,  
  
*Who's held me and blessed me."

So, while the American rapper schizophrenically creates a world in which he is God himself, the Brazilian Mc recognizes that his only merit is a supposed participation in the divine will (which, coincidentally, is almost always the same as his own).
