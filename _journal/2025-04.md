The noble side of womankind has but one desire, to take her rightful place at the side of a great, strong man. Currently this longing can only be fulfilled if she wins a man's love. Love makes her subservient to the man. But this love is not a natural one. Would this be the case, she would confront him naked. But a naked woman has no allure for a man. Unclothed, she certainly can arouse a man's passion, but not maintain his love. 

You will have heard the story that it was modesty that made woman adopt the fig leaf. How wrong that is! Modesty, a laborious emotion cleverly manufactured by cultural structures, was alien to the primitive human race. Woman clothed herself, and thereby made herself a mystery to man in order to fill his heart with a longing to solve the mystery.

It is apparent that changes in men's attire are brought about by the striving of the great majority to (at least) appear distinguished. Through this imitation they devalue the original distinguished styles and force the true arbiters of elegance - or those considered such by the people - to look for another style. The changes in women's clothing styles, however, are simply dictated by fluctuations in sensuality.

Barrison Sisters then, kpop now. 2025 is the year when you need to look like a sexualized but innocent porcelain doll to get a husband. I didn't make the rules, baby. Adjust to the meta.
