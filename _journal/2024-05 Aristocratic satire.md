#  2024-05: Aristocratic satire

A clear indicator of one group's intellectual superiority over another is the natural emergence of a type of satirical comedy that doesn't need punchlines, or where they are entirely optional. This type of satire presupposes that one group is in the position of looking down on the other. From this higher perspective, merely representing the beheavior from an inferior group is all the humor needed in a scene.

 You observe this phenomenon in left-wingers vs boomers, RW K-pop groups compared to the average K-pop cattle, Miladies vs apes, Roman aristocracy with the typical parvenu and so on.
