## Halo CE

Most of the things this game does well are so subtle and so unique that much of it is still lost on people. Can't be captured in conventional gamer language. I first played this game as a young child and every time I've returned to it my opinion of it has only gotten higher.

## Pikmin

The games Nintendo made for the Gamecube themselves were all seriously ambitious conceptual leaps, overlooked for their cute simplicity which disguised their elegance. They work so well we take the utterly original premises and systems for granted. The premise of a game like Pikmin works so well that it feels _inevitable_.

## Deadrising 

Stunning game. Heavy, tactile, responsive, formal and new. Video game tradition and contemporary popular culture played so straight but made into something so strikingly original. Like Halo it's a game that should become more impressive the more you think about it. Even all these years later few have taken it seriously enough to see what's really going on.

## X-COM

Possibly the greatest "tactical" experience in the history of game systems. The game's premise feels so realised. Everything that could be relevant is there and just _works_. A world of objects and entities with characteristics and functions and goals and you have a perfectly satisfying and complete-feeling spread of potential inputs. It's a game that makes it feel like you can do anything, while also feeling like a complete formal system rather than a chaotic sprawl that stops rather than completes. Conversion mods are being made today of this game that came out on floppy discs. Glorious testament to its fundamental systems.

## Killer7

This game feels like something that could have been made in a world where no other video game that exists. That it was made in ours is perhaps even stranger. And somehow Shinji Mikami was involved. I'm sure his steady hand was vital to get this finished, the presence of such a formal-minded veteran had no sway over this game's utterly alien character and approach to realising its premise. Suda51 is not a video game developer. He's an outside artist with a multimedia team. They gave us Killer7.

## Evergrace

Evergrace is a very weak video game. Far from being a fundamental issue, I simply shift my perception. The video game is not a fundamental element of Evergrace. It's a multimedia work centered around a few pieces of key visual art and Kota Hoshino's beautiful "indigenous" soundtrack.
