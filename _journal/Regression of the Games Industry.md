# Regression of the Games Industry


_Jan 17, 2022 at 11:25am_

This can only be a result of encroaching self-awareness on the part of mediocre poseurs (trying to no longer call them artfaggots). The people who actually drive things forwards aren't driven by this general sense of "we should be going forwards". It's what you do when you're alive and full of life.

If we want to talk about particular games, AAA has undeniably gone backwards on the whole. Games are aiming to do less than they were 20 years ago. 20 years ago we were limited by the tools at our disposal. Now we're limited by everything being run by faggots and retards (in the west anyway). Classic Bungie to 343 Industries the difference is night and day. Productively playful and laid back high IQ straight white males fucking around seeing what they could make computers do to an identityless rabble of button pushers with the shots being called by w*men and "industry" faggots who don't have the heads for that brainy _actually making the game_ stuff. 343 were recently lauded for opening up Halo and aiming bigger with Infinite, it's a boring unambitious mess sets itself by being 343's big redemption moment of not willfully repudiating everything that made halo fun anymore. I've read unconfirmed reports that pretty much every praised feature that suggests a shred of vision and understanding of the possibility of the original parts the game was reluctantly jammed in as good as possible before release due to the influence of the remaining powerful bungie oldfag (joe staten) and that without him it would have been pretty much devoid of merit.

The plan for Halo 2's multiplayer was to create a living battlefield in which multiple players would compete on each side in campaign-like scenarios with NPCs and setpieces and complex objectives, it was going to be the halo campaign experience but cooperative effort against cooperative effort. But due to the constraints of tech and time they were forced to cut this and revert back to Halo CE's party-game multiplayer but online. Look at the state of games today and this compromise move is STILL the standard in fps. The vision was there in 2003, do we lack the means now?

At best we have stuff like Battlefield, which has been static for about as long if not now sliding backwards. Squad and other sim-leaning games that are still games? Something I guess, but the lack of narrative and crafted spectacle has me thinking it's still just a new theme for the deathmatch partygame. I do like the scope, but it's a niche product and a niche production that just doesn't feel like the game of the future to me. Child me playing Halo CE did not dream of a future playing 'Squad'.

At some point games stopped driving into the future and we all feel it. And it's absolutely not a question of grey men in suits who don't love games. Japan is the land of grey men in suits and they're the only ones doing anything interesting on an advanced level of production anymore. It's not that the west won't take financial risks. Presented on paper anybody would have told you that The Last of Us 2 was an abysmal idea that nobody would like, risks are being taken all the time, but the shots are called by HR roasties and neurotic poser kikes like Neil Druckman. In Japan the risks are taken by proven men of vision and aspiring favourites of the grey men.

Please come back grey men. Of course I consider Gamergate to be the true breaking point between grey men gaming industry and this religious totalitarian stranglehold we're suffering under now.

More I'd like to say but I'll cut myself off here.
