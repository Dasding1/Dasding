#  2024-05: About a strange dream
![[5187.jpg]]

The internet has created this funny situation in which the ascetic's cave is millimeters away from the prostitute's lair, and yet they remain perfectly immiscible. Vehicles were already impactful, but the web surely marks the ultimate victory of time over space. Virtually all distances are condensed in a process that perpetually edges toward zero.

Consider DMs. You're sharing some sort of space with another person, but the vast physical distance between you and your interlocutor is completely engulfed by a meta-space. Isn't it ridiculous to think that we can send our presence anywhere on the planet, like a parody of angelic bilocation?

Anyway, I'm talking about all this because a few nights ago I had a feverish dream. 

I could see fifty years passing in minutes through a delirious, ultra-accelerated timelapse. People of all ethnicities whispered the same strange dialect in my ear—a kind of degraded English—, while humanity as a whole was slowly being dragged to a sort of post-geographic non-place. Then, I saw a sharp structure, dizzyingly tall and translucent. This tower was in a realm beyond realms, which appears and disappears at an extraordinary speed everytime two network packets interact. It was continuously flickering in and out of existence, making tiny ripples in God's eye fluid, as if taking care not to attract His attention (again).
