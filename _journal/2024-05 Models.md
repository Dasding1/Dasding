![[5030.jpg]]

Midwits sometimes gripe about models never 'having anything interesting to say' or any quality beyond their beauty, unaware that their role is to carry the discourse of silence, the image that suffices as a means of expression, not needing any rationalization or footnotes. 

The only thing expected of models is that they have manners, yet this merely symbolizes the aspiration to harmonize inner beauty with physical charm as closely as conceivable. After all, no one desires a mermaid with Cyclops' hands.
