# 2024-05 Models
![[5030.jpg]]

Midwits sometimes gripe about models never 'having anything interesting to say' or any quality beyond their beauty. As usual, they're sidestepping the real issue. The purpose of models is to carry *Ḥašmal*, the discourse of silence, the image that suffices as a means of expression, not needing any rationalization or footnotes.

The only thing expected of them is that they have manners, yet this merely symbolizes the aspiration to harmonize inner beauty with physical charm as closely as conceivable. After all, no one desires a mermaid with Cyclops' hands.
