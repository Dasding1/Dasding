# Semen Retention

> I have seen the face GOD for i do not spill my seed. I have been practising this for 2 decades, brothers it is not an easy road especially at the start, but persist DO NOT GIVE UP.the dreams of corruption can be overcome just as the images of wakening can also be overcome.i have travelled to the relms that are hidden, i have seen and understood the knowledge of that which is greater than myself, i brng my knowledge to you to help you on your path of discovery. JOIN ME brothers we will ascend.

No man has ever saw god and lived to tell about it, because the visage of god kills all men who have ever seen it. 

Not that I believe that God even has a face, but the Western comprehension of God is that of an anthropomorphic Super Saiyan humanoid alien so they're prone to saying a bunch of goofy shit that's completely at odds with what damn near the rest of the world's cultures & religions see, which is generally a holographic grid of some sort.  
  
First off, I do find it hilarious how Occidental people (It doesn't matter if they claim to be Right or Left wing, they both act exactly the same, hysterical & zealous.) always demonize the act of fornication or the naked body, as though it were immoral. The bible or Genesis never actually condemns the naked body, and it often described people as naked such as Adam & Eve. Bible does condemn fucking outside of marriage, but even that's not clear because it also seems to be okay with harems, multiple wives & concubines. Kinda like how in Japan, it was considered normal & even encouraged to have mistresses as a form of stress relief. That seems to have phased out though since lately, Lefty Open Society Americans have been trying to colonize the shit out of Japan's culture and little by little Japan is forced to conform.  
  
I honestly think that this current DeJapanization movement on Japan is an aberration because in a book from the 90s (I think it was "Committee of 300", I forget.)  

Klaus Schwab actually viewed the Japanese people as off limits and didn't want to restructure their culture or society, because he always respected how obedient their populace is to their elite class & he actually wanted to mold the rest of the world to be like the Japanese.  

The current day insanity & hatred towards the Japanese, (Such as Leftards trying to rewrite Japanese history through wikipedia, American tourist vandalizing Japanese religious establishments & now there's even Occidental video games that do a mixture of both against Japan to the point that even the Prime Minister condemned it.) seems to be more of the cause of Millennials like Alex Soros (via Rahm Emanuel who has been doing nothing but shaming Japan for not being 'modern' and 'civilized' like Americans lol), a lot of Millennials don't understand why some traditions are off limits (because if changed, the entire house fall apart.), so they went full speed ahead with Agenda 2030 (The Google definition of 2030, like nearly everything on google. Is intentionally wrong.) Which (2030) is a restructuring of the world (by Elites) based around a select few Mega cities entirely surveyed through SMART technology. One of these Megacities was going to be the entirety of Japan refashioned as one huge virtual reality simulation city scape (This is what Kagura is modeled after in my Heretic Hydra setting, since all I'm doing with my setting is trying to drip-feed you with as much hidden knowledge as I can, without saying too much. Like how OG Cozy Okada & Kazuma Kaneko did it, for my generation.), not unlike the cyberworld from Devil Summoner Soul Hackers.  
  
The Atlus Okada & Kaneko duo were hardcore occultists, so damn near all of the games that they worked on were slowly drip-feeding you about the controllers of this realm from behind the curtain in Wizard of Oz.  

I use the word "realm" specifically, because we don't actually know what we're living in. All throughout history, this world was always claimed to be an illusion, hologram or the modern term, simulation. China & Japan are both well aware that the world is fucking fake. I'm not sure about Koreans, since they're way too influenced by the West.  

Ironic really, because even Jesus makes constant references to Earth being an illusion or just a passing world. The problem is that mainstream White worshippers of Jesus, take everything so damn literally & materially.  
  
The Persona 1,Persona 2 Duology were showing to you how the world is shaped through perception with the P2 duology focusing on Retrocausality and how reality is just the collective perception of the world's populace, and said reality will retroactively change to reflect the present. (Megaten games never tell you this straight up. They expect you to either know the subjects that it's referencing or for you to look it up yourself, which back in the day when these games first came out. You had to physically move your ass to libraries that contained occult texts. Unlike in the modern era where large texts are exchanged through USBs and memory cards. Everything online is fake due to Corpo-internet so there's a work around where you don't use the net at all, other then for distribution purposes)  
  
Not that it matters what the bible says, since most of it is contradictory and is not even meant to be literal to begin with. 

The stories are meant to impart spiritual truths to you, through allegory. Nothing in the occult is literal, and that includes the bible, which is considered as an occult text. It's just been massively altered & distributed for mass consumption for literal retards who literally believe in Sky Ghost Daddy Super Saiyan Superman that watch them pee & shit. It's Santa Claus for Cargo-Cult primitive-minded Adults.  
  
**Side Note:**  
Rake was trying to get me to join this forum again back in 2023 so he showed me this Occult section & I only saw this part of the forum. (I really should've checked out the rest of the site. I was honestly pissed that it had a thread on Fatal Frame but none on Shin Megami Tensei, only to find out a few months ago that it has a section devoted to SMT. I like Fatal Frame, FF is cool. I consider FF more as paranormal rather than occult. FF is occult-adjacent at best. SMT is occult.)

It was this specific post by alleged SemenRetentionGuru (alleged because he only has a meme comprehension of what Semen Retention is.) that I read last year, which had me convinced that this site became a bunch of internet right wing retards (This bastardrized version of SemenRetention, is a belief that's only believed by morons within the Right wing & Men's rights circles of the internet.) so I didn't even bother to drop by here until Trump won. So I could gloat about how I was correct about damn near everything, that a lot of this troon scare hysteria is manufactured.

(Fuck this dumbass forum for claiming that I got brainwashed by troon ideology because I kept trying to claim that it's an exaggerated forced non-issue meant to elicit a response from over emotional morons, when 1. I don't even know what that is. I think like a Jap. I only acknowledge two groups. Japs, and people who aren't Japs. Guess where 'troon ideology' falls under? Not Japs, duh!!! 2. I barely use the internet for anything other than downloading or watching movies, & video games. This forum is the only site that I ever bothered to post or communicate at, on a regular basis. Once I left this forum, I didn't use the internet at all outside of watching movies on youtube & longplays. I only wrote texts to people over the phone.)  
  
None of these Military or Government Troons have ever held real power, all of their government positions are fake and gay (Fucking Linda Mcmahon of the World Wrestling Federation has far more political power than any of these Troon purse puppies ever had. ), and will easily be swept away by the next Republican who takes office.  
The only thing I didn't predict, that it'd be Trump who would be next in line, and the one to destroy the Tranny tower of power that was made out of Legos.  
  
Yes there's a difference between an actual right winger & an internet right winger.  
The internet right wingers generally believe in a lot of hysterical magical stupid bullshit. (They actually thought that Trannies had power, when as I said, it's actually the women who manage them who have the power, because it's still a White man's world and honestly always will be, even these annoying Feminists understand that.)

Actual real life right wingers can easily be described as pragmatic, and won't ever concern themselves with weird internet hysteria because it doesn't reflect their everyday life, which would revolve more around the higher cost of groceries, gas, guns & ammo.  
  
When I read this post last year, I didn't read in between the lines to see that it's actually a joke post, a satire. It's actually making fun of you, and me. Although I really don't understand how it's meant to be a mockery of me when I don't recall being a Christcuck. I identify as Christian yes, but I don't ever speak or act like an Occidental Christian who loosely tries to weave morals from an ancient book, that they stupidly try to impose on the modern world nearly 3000 years later, as if that weren't fucking retarded. I'm not a literalist. The bible is just a series of lessons written by primitive cargo cult retards trying their hardest to comprehend the 'magic' that they were witnessing when said magic was actually just our modern day technology. The Black Mirrors that you often see being spoken of throughout most of the world's ancient, historical & religious texts are actually just a reference to modern day Smart phones, which guess what? Have a black screen of glass, like a black mirror and you can call forth services from your phone just like the alleged magic that ancient texts have alleged that black mirrors can do. The Sega game Like a Dragon & Infinite Wealth does an excellent parody of this through their poundmates summons

Which yes, is meant to be a parody of Final Fantasy, but both Final Fantasy & Yakuza are directly basing this off of the Black Mirror myths. (The reason why Jap games are the way they are, is because they do a lot of research on this shit. Koudelka gets extremely detailed with this shit.) Some people are able to piece together that Black Mirrors were just the ancient primitive cargo cult word for Smart phone. Kinda like how Maya, is basically just the ancient version of Simulated reality.  

**This is how I interpret the world. Everything is just science, being misinterpreted by retards** , and what you notice is this sounds nothing like these vague allusions to god that the op post does.  
  
_______  
  
Back to the post.

> Let me introduce to you the concept and practice of semen retention. this ancient practice has been practiced by the Egyptian mysticks, the greek philosophers, roman senators, chinese wise men, indian gurus, geoff, buddah, confucsious. The japanese monks of have teachings of this practice performed with the ritual of self preservation. In the dead sea scrolls it is mentioned as a way to overcome original sin and find the path closer to God. More recently there have been strides made in the knowledge, the true knowledge of the true power it can grant. FOR MODERN day, modern times, we are surrounded by sexual images and pornoGrAPHY. It is this later in particular, GRAPHIC images, that corrupt the soul and the will to live, the will to progress and ascend

Like a lot of retarded internet right wing memes, the belief in Semen Retention takes half truths (such as faggy asexual Buddhist monks do indeed practice semen retention.) but then creates some modern day narrative that loosely tries to connect with issues that plague modern day Zoomers & Younger Millennials (1985-1995) 

In this case it's some mixture of being a bunch of unfuckable, unlovable virgin nerds mixed with some weird Soccer Mom mentality where they think they can make the world a better place by regulating porn. The porn isn't the problem, the ones addicted to it, are. I honestly had no idea that there existed large swaths of Zoom Zooms & Gen Y who whack off several times a day. I didn't even know that until I heard rumors about Nick Fuentes who's been claimed to wack off about 5 times a day. I don't even understand how any man could do that, because I generally lose interest after nutting once and then I move on,  

What the misinterpretation is, is that the energy gained through semen retention revolves around an energy explosion that's to be used towards the pursuit of art. It has nothing to do with any of these goofy men's self improvement crap or some simple message of time management. Was this meant to be a spiritual message or a materialistic one, because it sounds materialistic to me with the focus on time, or somehow it's assumed that it's women who's been corrupting you, when women can't control you, only you can control yourself.  

Another misinterpretation is that they do not actually abstain from masturbation.  
What they're trying to do is control their orgasm (I'm disgusted that I have to explain the sexual practices of a bunch of old dudes.), the point of semen retention is to masturbate just long and hard (lol) enough, but to stop at just the right moment before they bust a nut. They're trying to reach that orgasmic high, but without the mess that follows after.  
  
That's where the power comes from. Even Hitler did this shit, it's probably where the modern myths of this bullshit came from.  

Some Internet 'Monarchist' Catholic retard who believed that Hitler was Catholic (he wasn't, just like how George Washington wasn't actually Christian.) probably got word that he practiced Semen Retention but since most internet retards don't know how to fucking read, he simply took the words Semen Retention at face value then built an entire myth around it, not realizing that it actually does revolve around playing with your dick , but to stop at just the right moment before they ejaculate.

(The entirety of Occultism is a metaphor for God, Procreation. How do you procreate? Oh yeah, by fucking.)  

A lot of what you see on the internet is fucking fake. (Both the Right & Left believe in every dumb thing they read on the internet.) 

You need to get your info directly from either the source, or books that reference the initial source.  

I was annoyed when I saw this post last year because I thought it was a real sincere post written by a retard, but upon rereading it, it's an obvious satire of the imbeciles who actually believe in this shit and the poster in question is actually pretty smart. (If he indeed wrote it as an insult. However he is a fucking moron, If he genuinely believes in this weird mishmash of conflicting Western & Eastern mindsets and some weird back in forth between trying to be a spiritual message that keeps referring to materialist reality which honestly has always been a problem that I have with White Right wingers, they're all so materialistic and care way too much about what other people do, rather than focusing on what they can change, themselves. I'm giving the Guru the benefit of the doubt, I believe that he was actually making fun of the website/forum. I view site/forum as both the same. I prefer this, because it means that he has some intelligence if he intended his posts as a mockery or insult)

>Imagine a normal day, you awake full of vim and vigor and have many plans for what you wish to achieve that day. But then you look at your social media and there is some video of a female "working" out in those yoga pants, another image after, another female in a tiny bikini barely covering her ample chest., another image a 2d waifu licking an ice cream suggestively HOW IS A MODERN MAN TO COPE? YOU IMMEDIATLY waste time masturbating, and once the deed is done, you are drained, drained of energy, drained of WILL TO LIVE.  
> THIS is DELIBERATE, it is the deliberate energy harvesting from THEM. to spill our seed is the same as to spill our BLOOD.  
> WE give them everything and they give us NOTHING in return.
> Afterwards you are weak. Suspectiable to to the demon of ADVERTIZING. You buy the useless overpriced item that comes up in the "TEMU" feed. You are hungry and what you should have is a healthy nutrious meal but you are DRAINED OF ENERGY and you cannot access this so you eat the bag of GMO potato chips enriched with soya and corn syrup which fills you but it is empty calories. THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINING. The shame of masturbating so often and to everything combined with the lak of real food and company causes the endless spiral of MISERY WEAKNESS AND DEATH. IMAGINE a life of this, the endless cycle. BUT there is hope, for you too, can escape. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR SEED. YOUMUST RETAIN IT. FORESAKE ALL GRAPHIC IMAGES, FORESAKE FEMALES for they are the corrupted. They are the impure. They seek to oppress man, to weaken and destroy him.

This post and this specific quote, it just all over the place. Now granted, it's written like a typical 'Red Pill' men's rights activist message where the reader is assumed to be a victim. A victim not of his own doing, but because of external forces.  

It's written with the belief and mindset that you don't cause life to happen, life simply happens to you. 

You're not an occultist if you're just a passive loser who lives life on auto-pilot and let life happen to you.  Occult belief systems are actually structured around Jesus or what Jesus believes, ye are all gods. You are to be in an constant act of creations, whether that be through art (like David Lynch), or simple procreation.  
  
It's kinda like how, in Japan the colors baby blue and pink are still recognized as extremely feminine, cute & girly colors, but in the West and USA in particular that entire color scheme is now associated with transgenderism, so every time a Westerner sees baby pink and blue, they associate the color & the wearer, with trannies. I saw this dumb shit going on with the Yakuza live action tv show, where a bunch of dumbass Internet Right wingers were trying to call Yakuza tv show "woke" because there's a girl wearing blue & pink. Oh gee, I wonder why? Perhaps it's because for centuries those two colors blue & pink were traditionally associated with women. You fucking dumbass!  
  
This blue & pink color scheme doesn't have to be associated with troons unless you let it.  
Westerners let it happen because most westerners simply allow life to happen to them. They don't operate from the mindset that the current reality exists, because of their own thoughts. Only you can control your own reality.

I see the same things that the op describes, but I don't view naked women as a horror. I view it as reality, as it always has been and should be. How the fuck is the modern era any different from any other era in the past? Women were always harlots. I don't say that as an insult, I'm pointing out that it's dudes trying to impose their norms & morals on people who aren't dudes, women.  

Who's funding these women? The male consoomers who are paying these bitches. It's just capitalism working as it always has, except now the middle man management is the government via Onlyfans instead of a local pimp.  

The problem is the man, not the women. Abstaining from sex or masturbation ain't going to do shit since you losers already weren't fucking anyone to begin with. You'll just get replaced by another fat, smelly retarded consoomerist.  

What I fucking hate about fake Right wingers, is that they often seem to believe that they have to live the life of an ascetic monk or priest, to be considered as right wing or traditionalist.  

What you'll often see, are these corny ass Men's Self Improvement types who try to posture themselves as real manly men's men, but they'll often preach conflicting view points by generally appealing to Protestant Calvinist style hard work ethic as a moral virtue, and the abstinence of sex as if they were also larping as a priest or some other dickless eunuch monk, but when you look at them.

You can clearly see that they don't live this silly 'traditionalist' larp lifestyle at all. They're just pretending to be something they're not.  

Youtube often directs you to vids like this, if they detect that you're not an Open Society Fellow Traveler. This is done on purpose so you can be just as fucking retarded as the guy in the vid is. Sure he looks like a Chad, but is he? I don't think so. His eyes look soft. I dislike & block every youtube vid filled with retards like this who tries to enlighten me by saying some stupid Protestant work ethic, anti-sex screed, because I know just from seeing Americans, that this prot anti-sex shit ain't working. If it were, they wouldn't be so unhappy, and on meds all the time.  
  
Why the fuck would you want to be a faggy priest or monk, who merely stand around like losers waiting for god as they get killed by the barbarians at the gate?  What you want to be is a warrior. You'll often see me refer to myself as a warrior or a weapon. You never see me say any of this faggy priest shit, because Conan the Barbarian has the right idea.

That's what being a traditional man is. That Conan quote, sums up the wants & needs of everysingle heterosexual man. Not this weird ass 1950's larp of what a Millennial or Zoomer thinks a traditionalist man is supposed to be, which in their fucked up world view, is some kind of dickless faggot priest.  
  
That's why I don't take internet right wingers seriously. If you listen to them, you become just as dickless as the lefty troons that they hate. From my vantage point, what I see is that all roads available to you on the internet, all lead you down towards the same destination.  
Demoralization, and the usurpation of your own power (of creation) that you willingly gave up of your own accord because you thought you were making a moralistic statement against debauchery.  

Congratulations dumbass, you were easily persuaded through your own emotions of inadequacy or isolation.

**You wanna know a ritual that actually will make you mentally, spiritually & physically stronger?**  

Start taking showers in freezing cold water. That's how you'll learn to start thinking like a monk (without actually living like a holy faggot monk/priest.), because cold showers force you  to breathe differently and also forces you to think that "you're not actually freezing to death. You just think you are."  

Once you've mastered that, you'll start to see that the cold water is no longer drowning you, in fact it will start to rejuvenate you because you're finally on your first little baby step into mastering the world around you, by controlling your breathing and the way you think.  

It's like some kind of abstract Karate Kid Mr. Miyagi technique by forcing you to do something stupid, only for it to later teach you some important lessons in life that most people have never once thought of, such as the way that you breath can actually change your interpreted reality and control what is perceived pain, and actually turn that pain into a source of energy that you are rejuvenated by.  
  
I didn't get any of this from no damn book, or some stupid internet shit. I learned this through life experience.  I'm not denigrating books. I'm just making a point that real true lessons about life spirituality, actually revolve around a form of suffering, such as willingly freezing and drowning yourself to death, just to learn how to control it.  

Semen Retention? That's not a form of suffering, it's actually a form of pleasure lol. It just sounds like the opposite, because Zoomers & younger Millennials are sex deprived or something.  

It's funny from my perspective because Zoom Zooms and Gen Cry deify this semen retention shit, not realizing that in reality, they're actually saying that old dudes who play with their balls & stop jerking it right before ejaculation, is a long lost hidden and grandiose virtue. You know what this sounds like to me? It sounds exactly like what the Blavatsky self-insert was talking shit about in the Johnny Depp Ninth Gate movie, about how most Rich elites are just cultist retards who don't understand the books that they read. This is the same deal here, but replace Rich Elites with poor, downtrodden Zoomers & Young Millennials. Makes me wonder how even more retarded that Gen Alpha will turn out.  
  
Sure the retort is often that Millennials & Zoomers turned out retarded because people my age never taught them shit. 

How the fuck am I supposed to when I've been fucking banned from everything, and even when I start a new account, I get instantly banned. I get banned easily, because I'll actually tell you some real shit but since I know I cant, due to Corpo-internet, I just don't even bother. It's not my problem. (It actually is my problem, since there's a good chance that 20-30 years from now, I'll be unlucky and be the last living old millennial or gen x'r left who remembers what the world was like before the 90s. There's a high likelihood that I'll eventually be mobbed to death by zoom zooms & millennials, just like how it was millennials who banned me from mother fucking everything, just because my words make them cry. )  
  
No I don't have the fucking Heretic game ready, I wasted the entire month drawing pixels for the game, of big jiggly titty big booty sprites lol. I'll eventually get around to responding to the Lynch thread. I've had some weird real life experiences that I think sound exactly like a Lynch movie.  

> This is done on purpose so you can be just as fucking retarded as the guy in the vid is. Sure he looks like a Chad, but is he? I don't think so. His eyes look soft.

Edit: I realize that I prob need to elaborate more by what I mean when I say that this male influencer looks SOFT. 

Most actual real men, they have a particular glare or resting face that somewhat resembles mine. (Except mine looks crazier.) 

I call this look, The Wolf Eye.

![[Pasted image 20250422174422.png]]

Sure Tom Cruise & Sean Connery are actors, but they wouldn't naturally look like that to begin with if they didn't live a certain life style in reality

Physiognomy is real. Your face generally shows the true character of who you are, so you can't actually fake it to make it, unless that already was who you are to begin with. It's like the saying "Smile doesn't meet his face." What the materialist sees are two ladies men. Which sure they both are, but that's just an after effect of both dudes being very self-determined, confident and most of all, they both understand that they make the world around them, the world doesn't happen to them. The world restructured itself around them.  

They both lived as Gods because the world naturally conforms with them. The term "Man of God" has been completely bastardized by Christcucks who use that term to refer to any slave morality chump who worships the current state or establishment who rules over him.  
(These types generally think that a random person is a direct servant of their Super Saiyan God, like how some of these types view Trump lol. I ain't denigrating Trump. He's been nothing but nice to my family, his people recently sent my mom free swag, backpack, hat. Only ones from my fam who has suffered his wrath, were all HuWite liberals from NYC lol. I'm just using OrangeFatfuck as an example of how "Man of God" is often misused by Christians to the point that they call this slovenly Dorito, "Man of God".)  
  
What "Man of God" truly refers to is someone like Connery, Tom Cruise, or most obviously, Stallone & Mel Gibson. It's these types of Men who have a stare that acknowledges that the world retroactively conforms with them, because they live as Gods. "Live as God", means that they are Co-creators with the source, the original God consciousness that emanated the entirety of existence. None of these guys may be self aware that they are living as Gods, but they sure as fuck know that you get nothing out of life, that life doesn't expect out of you.  
  
The difference that these actors have, from the youtube guy is that the Youtube guy generally has a Deer in headlights look to his eyes. It doesn't matter how tough he portrays himself or how much muscles he has. (He's way more muscular than Tom Cruise, Sean Connery or I, combined. Doesn't matter, on the street he'd still get mugged because he looks gay. Whereas I bet Tom really is like his Vincent character in real life LOL!)  
Youtube guy knows how to talk the talk, he knows how to imitate the behavior but the issue is that his visage betrays godliness. Or rather, he knows not God. He doesn't look like a predator, he looks like prey. This man is not a Wolf.

Oh BTW I'm serious, start taking freezing cold showers for at least a minute - 5 (just until you learn the lessons from it. Don't actually harm yourself. If it's gotten to that point then you're learning nothing at all. The point is to feel no pain. To make pain, Fear you.), if for nothing else then as a mental exercise. You'll start to see that you can adapt to the cold freeze and the survival mechanism of the feel of drowning by changing how you breath, and how you think to the point where you no longer feel the pain and the water is no longer suffocating you. You'll instead feel revived, or reborn. It's probably what videogame characters are supposed to feel like when ever they refill their lives from diving into water or oldschool NES Golgo 13, from fucking.  

Fucking (Sexual Intercourse, I prefer the word Fuck, because it's much more visual & sounds less detached from the human spirit. Humans wouldn't have survived for as long as they had without a strong appetite for both violence & fucking.) is actually another method of rejuvenation or rebirth. The only reason why spiritually, sex with multiple partners is frowned upon amongst certain sects, is because your soul combines with the bitch that you just fucked.  (Now imagine how hilarious that visual metaphor gets when its two dudes like in Current Year ideology.)  This modern condemnation of everything relating to the naked body just sounds like American Puritan retards to me. (It's modern in that it's a holdover from the 1950s, pre 1950s USA was extremely sexual, or at least heterosexual. It just had a shame culture similar to Japan to where mistresses were expected but the mistress themselves were not respected. In the modern world, the mistresses are treated as the star, and the men as expendable. That's the issue that plagues Zoomers & Gen crY.)  
  
Americans have always tried to control sex through the use of morality, because it gives the government & corporations more avenues to monetize sex. (They'd monetize & control every bit of air that we breath, if they could find a way to get away with it. I dunno, just call the air racist. That usually works.) That's just so obvious, but it's an obvious tactic that goes over the heads of most White Right Wingers because the thought of sex seems to trigger so much emotion with both White Left & Right wingers. It's an amusing behavior but annoying at the same time because they act as if their disgust towards naked body or sex were a fundamental spiritual truth when God is just a metaphor for consciousness & creation. You can't create without sex, or birth. This is why new ideas are no longer being born, we currently live in a hellhole where ideas are being regulated against if it does not conform with the current orthodoxy.
