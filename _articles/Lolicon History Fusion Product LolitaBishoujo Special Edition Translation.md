# [Lolicon History] Fusion Product Lolita/Bishoujo Special Edition [Translation]

In this issue, there's a 6 page roundtable talk between the most influential and important members of Lolicon and Bishoujo manga history. There's a lot of information not available in English with few articles accurately covering the people involved, leading to much misconceptions that still circulate the western internet. Everything following this paragraph is my translation of the article in question with **coloured translator's notes** to deliver further info. Please keep in mind there are several different definitions of the word Lolicon, and in 1981, there wasn't a word for Otaku or a word for Moe or Waifu in regards to having a fondness for anime characters, so in these days Lolicon, Lolita, and Bishoujo were the words often used for expressing those concepts.  
  

**Lolicon Roundtable Talk**​

  
No matter how you slice it, Bishoujo seems to be booming. So it's for that reason we have gathered the 'authorities' in that field... Oh, the horror, the horror.  
  

The Lolicon's Path is Rocky and Deep  
  
Lolita, or how I learned to abandon normal romance and love Bishoujo.  
​

**(吾妻ひでお) Azuma Hideo (Bishoujo Mangaka)** **Current Status: Deceased (RIP)**  
  
You cannot talk about Bishoujo without mentioning him. He hasn't been making much of a stir recently, but he's still stirring nonetheless. Some worship him as the 'God of Lolicon', clapping their hands in prayer, morning and evening.

**(野口正之) Noguchi Masayuki (Biyoujo Mangaka)** ***Penname: (内山亜紀) Uchiyama Aki** **(**[**Link**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%86%85%E5%B1%B1%E4%BA%9C%E7%B4%80)**); Current Status: Alive (His Books are Available Digitally).**  
  
No longer able to run or hide from it, a man who is unmistakably a Lolicon. Recently applied in a readers' column for the Shoujo manga magazine 'Nakayoshi', and was happily selected as an honourable mention for the C-class. Apparently, he wants to close up shop as a Lolicon mangaka to walk the path of a Shoujo mangaka.

**(谷口敬) Taniguchi Kei (Lolicon Gekigaka) Status: Alive and well (See End Note)**  
  
He gave us a stern warning he will never allow us to publish a photo of his face, but nevertheless, we got him to let us publish it. His first public appearance... A brazen... No, no, a rosy-cheeked Biseinen Mangaka. After making his debut in 'Erogenica', he's currently writing for 'Daikairaku' at a serialisation pace.

**(早坂未紀) Hayasaka Miki (Lolicon Doujinshi Creator) Current Status: Unknown**  
  
More than fact, rather it's a foregone conclusion even he who boasts sparkling talent in the Doujinshi world is actually a Lolicon. Despite being so skilled, he's a modest man who hasn't earnestly drawn for a professional magazine. He's working as an assistant for Murakami Motoka and Azuma Hideo.

**(川本耕次) Kawamoto Kouji (Lolicon Editor)** **Current Status: Alive and Posting on Twitter (****[Link](https://twitter.com/shadowcity)****)**  
  
Has had Noguchi Masayuki draw Lolicon manga in 'Peke' and has had Azuma Hideo draw Bishoujo manga in 'Shoujo Alice', you could say he's the man responsible for the current boom. In addition, the phantom masterpiece Bishoujo photo book 'There's a lot of Girls in the City' is also his work. He's currently working hard, day and night, on ero-books over at Gunyuusha.

![[Pasted image 20250501194947.png]]

**(蛭児神建) Hirukogami Ken (Lolicon Degenerate) Current Status: Unknown**  
  
Whenever Lolicon is mentioned, he's always ready to talk about it. The man is like a street guru. Dressed in hunting cap, sun glasses, mask, and raincoat that have started appearing on dummies all around. He presides over the extreme Lolicon Doujinshi 'Youjo Fancier'.

![[Pasted image 20250501195041.png]]

**(藤本孝人) Moderator: Fujimoto Takato (Ordinary 30 Year-old Bachelor) Current Status: Unknown**  
  
Publisher of the long-established Mini-communication magazine 'Manga no Techou'. At first glance, he's a true and upright salaryman, but in this special article, he's revealed to be a jack of many trades. Talk about not judging a book by its cover. Recently, he's been subjected to a bunch of marriage interviews, but he has insisted he won't respond to any marriage interview photos unless the girl in question is wearing a sailor suit that fits his preferences.

**■Are you a Lolicon?**  
  
──"Today's talk is about Lolicon, so I would like to start by confirming whether everyone is a Lolicon."  
  
Noguchi: "I'm a Lolicon." (Blunt)  
  
Taniguchi: "I'm currently working for 'Daikairaku'. So I'm thinking this while looking at the other writing members, but perhaps I'm not the biggest Lolicon." **Manga Daikairaku:** [**Link**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%BC%AB%E7%94%BB%E5%A4%A7%E5%BF%AB%E6%A5%BD)  
  
──"There's always someone insisting 'I'm not a Lolicon!'."  
  
Taniguchi: "At least not a violent one."  
  
Kawamoto: "I'm a Lolicon. In the strictest sense of the word. Recently, there's been all sorts, like Heidi Complex or Alice Complex among other types. I'm just in it for the sailor suits (laughs)."  
  
──"Next, while I don't need to ask, but..."  
  
Azuma: "I'm different." (Blunt)  
  
Everyone: "Not this again."  
  
──"Well, let's leave the arguing aside. What about you, Hayasaka-san?"  
  
Hayasaka: "Everyone says I have it, so it must be true."  
  
──"Any noticeable symptoms?"  
  
Hayasaka: "Nothing more than my trembling hands."  
  
Hirukogami: "My dream is I want to hold my chest high and declare 'I'm a degenerate'."  
  
──"What's the difference between a degenerate and a Lolicon?"  
  
Hirukogami: "The difference is in action."  
  
──In any case, everyone has been speaking their minds, but what about you Azuma-san?  
  
Azuma: "Eh?"  
  
──"Earlier you mentioned you're different, that you're a Lolicon during work."  
  
Azuma: "... Something like that...."  
  
──"So you don't love anime Bishoujo?"  
  
Azuma: "No (laugh). Please don't ask just me; I came here to study what Lolicon are like today."  
  
Hayasaka: "Ah—is that so?"  
  
──"Though many people have awoken to Lolicon after reading Azuma-san's manga."  
  
Azuma: "I don't know. Are there really people like that?"  
  
──"Kawamoto-san has been handling Azuma-san's works for quite some time in 'Peke'." **Monthly Peke: [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peke)**  
  
Kawamoto: "I'm tooting my own horn, but I've been something of an important turning point in Azuma-san's life. I've turned the second-rate Azuma-san, who was drawing for Akitashoten and Futabasha, into a third-rate mangaka working for 'Peke'. Also, I had him draw Bishoujo manga for 'Shoujo Alice'. That was just turning him from an 'SF-mania artist' into a 'Lolicon artist', it feels like I'm changing him from one bad thing into something worse."  
  
Azuma: "Ah, that's true (laugh)."  
  
──"I believe Noguchi-san also started his career as a Lolicon artist in 'Peke'."  
  
Kawamoto: "He made his debut with the 'OUT' newbie manga award. And it was then I was wandering around the editorial department of Minori Shobou, trying to devise a cheap idea to make his manuscript fees cheaper." **Monthly Out:** [**Link**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%88%E5%88%8AOUT)  
  
Noguchi: "This is the man I first heard the word Lolicon from (laughs)."  
  
Kawamoto: "Back then, it wasn't popular at all. But I had some interest in it, so I asked Noguchi-kun to draw it since he had the qualities of a Lolicon."  
  
Noguchi: "I'm the type who's happy so long as he gets to draw girls (laughs)."  
  
──"Though looking at what Taniguchi-san published in 'Pafu', his girls were already very cute since then. That's why everyone's always insisting you must be a Lolicon." **Pafu:** [**Link**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B1%E3%81%B5)  
  
Taniguchi: "There's a noticeable difference between what the readers say about me and what I say about me not being a Lolicon, they're on separate wavelengths. Recently, I've started to understand their side, so if the readers insist I am one, then I may as well give in and accept it."  
  
──"Though I believe you have a fixation on drawing sailor suits."  
  
Taniguchi: "Not at all. ... When it comes to sailor suits these days, the tops are fine, but I don't care much for the skirts."  
  
Everyone: (Laughs)  
  
Azuma: "Do you like short skirts?"  
  
Taniguchi: "When it comes to skirts, I prefer midi, pretty much. The part where you can see half the knee makes midi the cutest."  
  
──"I knew it, so you enjoy drawing those kind of works."  
  
Taniguchi: "Well, I enjoy it, but... Saying that is enough to make me fine with this is a bit..."  
  
──"So it's a forbidden pleasure? (Laughs)"  
  
Hayasaka: "I wonder if the people being called Lolicon by society are people with little sisters. I've been wondering if that only applies to me."  
  
Hirukogami: "My friend has a little sister and he's been writing a novel about violating a little sister with her name."  
  
Everyone: "That's sick. (laughs)."  
  
Kawamoto: "There might be some truth to that. Like a desire for a little sister."  
  
Taniguchi: "True."  
  
──"Something like if you actually had a little sister, you want her to be like this?"  
  
Hayasaka: "I'm not conscious of it, but I believe it's there."  
  
Hirukogami: "That would make everyone who has a desire for a little sister into a Lolicon. If I also had a little sister, I would do this." (Gestures)  
  
Everyone: (Laughs)  
  
Azuma: "Please behave yourself! (Laughs)."  
  
──"In Tezuka Osamu's early works, he often concluded it with a 'become my little sister' 'sure', so now I'm wondering if perhaps Tezuka-san is the grandfather of Lolicon."  
  
Azuma: "Ah, it feels like that."  
  
Taniguchi: "Some parts of 'Phoenix' felt incestuous. Having sex with a little sister and mother, and creating a bunch of descendants." **Pheonix by Tezuka Osamu:** [**Link**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%81%AB%E3%81%AE%E9%B3%A5_\(%E6%BC%AB%E7%94%BB\))  
  
Hirukogami: "The motif of incest is common in Lolicon."  
  
Kawamoto: "I'm currently working on an ero-book, but I often write confession notes for that reason. Whenever I write a confession note for incest, I always talk about my little sister. I have an older sister, but no younger sister. It's probably because I cannot delude myself into doing it with my older sister no matter what. She's like a mother to me. The only things I can imagine that make for attractive material is stuff about doing it with a little sister. But when I think about it carefully, lines like 'become my little sister' are really raunchy ones (laughs)."

**■Where are the Lolicon Civil Rights?**  
  
Kawamoto: "I believe everyone potentially has the elements of a Lolicon. It's only by chance in this period we have things like anime Bishoujo characters, Azuma-san's manga, and the Bishoujo Noguchi-kun draws."  
  
Noguchi: "What I draw aren't Bishoujo. They're Biyoujo!" **美幼女 (Biyoujo) are anime girls younger than 美少女 (Bishoujo)**  
  
Kawamoto: "(Laughs). I believe there's places that grant social status where it's fine for Lolicon to be into that sort of stuff."  
  
Noguchi: "Lolicon gained civil rights?"  
  
Kawamoto: "In our current situation, suppose we have neither Azuma-san nor Noguchi-kun, nor the Bishoujo characters from Toei, how would there be Lolicon? I believe there's now places where you can publicly show you're a fan of Azuma Hideo as a Lolicon. In other words, couldn't you say we're accepted?"  
  
Noguchi: "I went to a marriage interview the other day."  
  
Everyone: (Bursts into Laughter)  
  
Noguchi: "You see, the matchmaker introduced me to the other party as a mangaka. So the woman in question didn't have any further background information beyond that. And when we met and did our greetings, she asks 'what kind of manga do you draw?'."  
  
Everyone: (Bursts into Laughter)  
  
Noguchi: "The reason I couldn't answer confidently at the time was because I thought I still didn't have civil rights. So I told her 'I draw all sorts' (laughs)."  
  
──"So what you're saying is despite the boom, you still don't have civil rights?"  
  
Azuma: "What I don't understand is why Lolicon is booming. Could such a thing have a boom?"  
  
Hirukogami: "In the past, Lolicon had a dark image, but thanks to Sensei, the image of a Lolicon is bright and fun. Noguchi-san's manga are especially fun. Like you're having fun drawing them. Like they're trying to turn me, who was indifferent to such, into a Hentai."  
  
Noguchi: "I won't deny that (laughs). Someone told me this, but even if the girls I draw wind up ravaged, the girls don't look hurt. He said he didn't get the impression they were being bullied from my manga (laughs). I'm the kind of guy that totally has fun drawing. After all, it's fun drawing girls."  
  
Azuma: "Do you like bullying?"  
  
Noguchi: "No, I inherently dislike the sight of blood; however, when I see an article about a young girl being bullied in the newspaper, it makes my heart skip a beat."  
  
Azuma: "That may be you in the future."  
  
Noguchi: "Only if I make a misstep (laughs)."  
  
──"It seems there was actually a person called Noguchi Masayuki in Yokohama who was arrested for bullying young girls."  
  
Noguchi: "Ah, you're right. The editor of Tatsumi Publishing called me over the phone to check up on me. And he was like 'Huh? You're there?' (laughs)."  
  
Azuma: "He was certain it was Noguchi-san (laughs)."  
  
──"But the name of the policeman that was arrested for climbing onto the stage during a live performance at a strip show theatre was Azuma Hideo, was it not?"  
  
Everyone: (Burst into Laughter)  
  
Azuma: "Uumu."

![[Pasted image 20250501195315.png]]

**■My Bishoujo**  
  
──"How do I word this? At what age is someone a Bishoujo to you?"  
  
Hirukogami: "For me, if they're past 14, they're past their prime (laughs)."  
  
Kawamoto: "I don't really find age to be relevant. The inner nature of a girl is more important than her actual age. On the one hand, the Tokyo high school girls are terrifying; they all look like female gang leaders. On the other hand, the high school girls riding on Roadpals around Gunma are very cute, they're so pure."  
  
──"Azuma-san, I believe you said a Shoujo is a Shoujo even if she's well-developed in the chest." **The God of Lolicon is into Oppai Loli.**  
  
Azuma: "Yeah, I believe I said that. But what about Hirukogami-san...?"  
  
Hirukogami: "Her chest must be completely flat." **Explains his fashionable choice of clothing.**  
  
Everyone: (Burst into Laughter)  
  
Azuma: "That's why we're different. He's unable to have a normal marriage."  
  
Kawamoto: "Well, Lolicon are usually unable to have normal marriages. When I called Azuma's home for the first time, his wife picked up and I thought she was totally a middle schooler."  
  
──"So Azuma-san didn't have a normal marriage (laughs)."  
  
Azuma: "It was normal. What are you saying? I also have children. Is it that unbelievable for a Lolicon to have kids!?"  
  
Hirukogami: "I think it's about time you put up a wire fence around your home."  
  
Azuma: "Everyone's after my daughter (laughs). Someone's gotta do it."  
  
──"So you wanna keep her by your side and never let her get married for the rest of her life?"  
  
Azuma: "No, nothing of the sort. Cause I'm a normal human."  
  
Everyone: (Bursts into Laughter for some Reason)  
  
**■Sailor Suits and Randoseru**  
  
Azuma: "Sailor suits, they're part of Lolicon, right?"  
  
Taniguchi: "Well, you see (he's been quiet till now, so he's suddenly leaning his body forward). Err, those things had a boom 10 years ago, didn't they? The protagonists during the boom back then were all wearing sailor suits. So isn't this just a prolongation of that?"  
  
Hirukogami: "I'm bad when it comes to high school girls; whenever I hear their high-pitch voices, it makes me want to pull out the ropes to tie them up, and..."  
  
Everyone: "So you want to do that (laughs)?"  
  
Kawamoto: "After all, the ideal is the middle school sailor suit. Tokyo high schoolers don't look good in them. Budding breasts and a height around 155cm, those kinds of girls should wear sailor suits."  
  
Hirukogami: "Their sailor suits are worn all year round, so no matter how you slice it, they're filthy. Glistening with their skin oils."  
  
──"By the same token, are the glistening skin oils on Hirukogami's Randoseru good?"  
  
Hirukogami: "Ah! Randoseru are good alright. I recently got a hold of one, but it's been used for 6 years, so the sweat-soaked red Randoseru is irresistible."  
  
Kawamoto: "(Laughs). I bet you were wearing the Randoseru over your head and rolling around."  
  
──"Did you bring it with you today?"  
  
Hirukogami: "No way. I have it carefully on display back home."  
  
Everyone: (Laughs)  
  
Kawamoto: "I'm just your regular guy wearing bloomers and rolling around."  
  
Taniguchi: "Ah, bloomers are nice."  
  
Kawamoto: "Not just Chouchin-bloomers, but a form-fitting jersey. Those are nice." **Chouchin-bloomers (_ちょうちんブルマー)_ are a specific kind of bloomer.**  
  
──"How do you feel about leotards?"  
  
Kawamoto: "Umm. Girls in leotards aren't cute, to be honest."  
  
Taniguchi: "(Nodding). They're uncute."  
  
Kawamoto: "I would rather have a school swimsuit than a leotard."  
  
──"You're a very plain man."  
  
Kawamoto: "I want to keep it simple with stuff that has their name written on the chest."  
  
──"How does that make it good?"  
  
Kawamoto: "Um, you see, they're all dressed the same. So it makes the cute girls stand out."  
  
**■Licca-chan Doll Craze**  
  
──"How does everyone feel about dolls?"  
  
Taniguchi: "Dolls are nice, aren't they?"  
  
Hayasaka: "Hirukogami-san is unchallenged when it comes to dolls."  
  
Hirukogami: "I like them. I have about 20 Licca-chan dolls. Of course, it's boring playing with them normally. Superhero dolls are about the same size as Licca-chan so having Ultraman don Licca-chan's outfits is pretty cute. I also have dolls called G.I. Joe. Though I only have about 5 of them. If I combine the G.I. Joe and Licca-chan dolls, they perfectly encapsulate the body shapes of an adult and child." **Licca-chan ([Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AB%E3%81%A1%E3%82%83%E3%82%93))**  
  
Everyone: "Guwaah (laughs)."  
  
Hirukogami: "I enjoy posing them in various positions."  
  
Azuma: "Y, you're sick (laughs)."  
  
Kawamoto: "You're twisted (laughs)."  
  
Noguchi: "Hirukogami-san dropped by my place the other day, and showed me a big fight between Licca-chan and G.I. Joe (laughs). Ever since then, my impression of dolls has been pretty positive."  
  
Azuma: "So you're doing a Licca-chan doll delivery service?"  
  
Hirukogami: "I wouldn't quite call it a delivery service."  
  
──"Do you have any Petite Angie dolls?" **Her Majesty's Petite Angie ([**Link**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A5%B3%E7%8E%8B%E9%99%9B%E4%B8%8B%E3%81%AE%E3%83%97%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%A2%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A7))**  
  
Hirukogami: "Yeah, there's 5 kinds of those. From Takara. Well, I have a big and small one. It's already an old anime, so they're hard to come by. Even though Candy Candy is currently selling, Petite Angie is way cuter and has a better personality! I dislike hypocritical characters like Candy Candy." **Candy Candy ([Linkj](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E2%99%A1%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3))**  
  
──"Azuma-san is also pretty particular about Petite Angie."  
  
Azuma: "Yeah, I also like her. I'm a close match for him in that area. Though I'm still a loser; only have 3 of them."  
  
Everyone: (Burst into Laughter)  
  
Hirukogami: "Do you have any cels?"  
  
Azuma: "Well, I received 2 or 3."  
  
Hirukogami: "Gentlemen, he has cels for Petite Angie."  
  
Taniguchi: "However, not all of them."  
  
Azuma: "Yeah, just the ones where she's tied up at the watermill."  
  
Hirukogami: "Somehow, that's really cute. Ufufufufufu."

**Azuma Hideo's Waifu: Petite Angie. His obsession for this character extends to him expressing a desire to become Angie.  
  
■Lolicon is an Ideal**  
  
──"I'm of the opinion Takemiya Keiko's 'Fly Me to the Moon!' is the perfect Lolicon manga." **'Fly Me to the Moon':** [**Link**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A7%81%E3%82%92%E6%9C%88%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A7%E9%80%A3%E3%82%8C%E3%81%A6%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6!)  
  
Azuma: "Ah, I agree."  
  
Kawamoto: "However, I believe women do not understand Lolicon on a fundamental level."  
  
Noguchi: "I also think so."  
  
Kawamoto: "Most of them are Fashionable Lolicon."  
  
Hayasaka: "The ones called female Lolicon like small, cute girls, but they also like cute boys and cute children."  
  
Kawamoto: "They lack distinction and principle, you could say they lack the ideal."  
  
──"The ideal?"  
  
Kawamoto: "All Lolicon have an ideal."  
  
Noguchi: "Sounds like you're trying to split hairs (laughs)."  
  
Kawamoto: "No, I'm making a point. There are Lolicon that stick to school swimsuits, there are Lolicon that stick to Randoseru, but when it comes to female Lolicon, the only thing that matters to them is whether something is cute. They're unprincipled Lolicon, so I cannot recognise them as Lolicon. After all the path of a Lolicon is much deeper."  
  
Noguchi: "Ah, so it's a matter of depth? (Laughs)."  
  
Hayasaka: "For some reason, I'm starting to feel afire with desire."  
  
Hirukokami: "I'm still a long ways from that."  
  
Hayasaka: "You'll need to seclude yourself in the mountains with a Randoseru for about three years (laughs)."  
  
Kawamoto: "Though it's been getting a little crazy lately, Lolicon isn't dark at all. In fact, I believe someone said this but, Shoujo are beautiful, but we who love those Shoujo aren't beautiful. That is to say, some are coming into this with the misconception Lolicon is beautiful. I believe Azuma-san's manga provides a cover for that; 'I'm not a Lolicon, but I am a fan of Azuma Hideo'. That's why it's become very cool to call things Lolicon. I think that's a bad trend. After all, those who love Shoujo aren't beautiful in the slightest."  
  
Hayasaka: "It's not beautiful, but it's defiant. That's why you have those saying doing ○○ and ×× is Lolicon."

![[Pasted image 20250501195501.png]]

**The perfect Lolicon manga according to the moderator.  
  
■Lolicon is Sexual Science Fiction**  
  
Perhaps you don't know anything about Lolicon being sexual science fiction, but it's not limited to Lolicon; Homo, Lez, Sado, Maso, and all the other sex besides the so-called 'normal sexual relationships' are akin to science fiction. Perhaps you could call them science fiction of the lower body. Among their commonalities are suppressed desires, possibility and imagination, and a degree of hatred towards 'reality', Lolicon and SF are very similar in the aspect where they're strangely pessimistic.  
  
However, that is not to say most of what is being written is Lolicon SF. There are many SF where girls appear, but those aren't necessarily Lolicon, just like having a girl appear doesn't make something a porno.  
  
That said, it's not completely out of the question. Out of all the works I'm going to mention, if I have to give a perfect example, is Hoshi Shinichi's early work 'Moon's Light'. This is the story of a middle-aged man who keeps a mixed-race girl as a pet. Though the girl was an abandoned child, the man did nothing to educate her as a human, instead he raised her as a beautiful pet. The pet girl was attached to the man. The man, of course, didn't do anything to her. He was merely fascinated by her presence. **Hoshi Shinichi ([Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%98%9F%E6%96%B0%E4%B8%80))**  
  
Robert Young's 'The Dandelion Girl' is also a romantic Lolicon SF. Her dandelion hair dancing in the wind, a girl standing in the afternoon sunshine comes from a future two hundred forty years away. The man admonishes his agitated self. 'Hey, hey, I'm forty-four.' Young, very much a Lolicon, introduces charming girls even in his 'Jonathan and the Space Whale'.  
  
Speaking of charming, Mitsuse Ryuu's 'Asura King' also has a different kind of charm. In 'Ten Billion Days and One Hundred Billion Nights', he introduces an androgynous Bishoujo who possesses a sublime beauty that transcends gender. Though there's many nostalgic stories about boys by Ray Bradbury, the 'April Witch' is a short story that symbolically depicts the fluttering heart of an adolescent girl. (**Kobayashi Katsuaki**) **This person (小林克彰) shouldn't be confused for the Guilty Gear CV of the same name. So far, this is the only time I've seen this name mentioned.  
  
Unlike the other pieces written alongside the roundtable talk (i.e. one about male crossdressers commenting on sailor uniforms), I felt this one was important to translate to show how important western science fiction media was to budding artists in Japan and Lolicon itself.  
  
The Lolicon Boom mentioned earlier in the talk was happening alongside a Star Wars boom, and as Uchiyama Aki (Noguchi Masayuki) later mentioned in an out-of-panel note in an issue of Lemon People, there isn't a single Japanese mangaka who hasn't been influenced by American comics.  
  
The reason Azuma is treated with such high regard is because Japan was importing the dark Lolicon from Europe and North America (Junior Idol-type pornography), and he turned that dark image around to something fun and positive with his manga Lolicon. The manga and anime industry wouldn't be the way it is right now if it weren't for the above artists influencing all the artists that gained recognition overseas like Takahashi Rumiko, Nagai Go, Toriyama Akira, among others.  
  
Despite that, most of these people haven't really transitioned to the internet age.  
Taniguchi Kei, the Lolicon Gekigaka, is still alive and well, posting on the internet.

**This magazine went through several incarnations, and trying to find old issues of its first couple incarnations is difficult (I don't even know how many issues exist of the older stuff; it's that undocumented and obscure).**  
COMICモモ→ロリコンKISS→月刊COMICロリタッチ→コミックBeat  
  
**But It Was Supposed to be Fooling Around, Self-Aware It Was The Evil Path From The Very Beginning!?  
  
Hirukogami Ken**  
  
  
It all started in the manga Doujinshi world. A reserve army of mangaka wanting to show others the creations they drew, bringing and selling works to one another published at their own expense, there was once such an exhibition giving the vibe of those playing house.  
  
From such a place, works called 'Lolicon Doujinshi' began to circulate from the late 70s to the beginning of the 80s. Amateur creators who grew up under the influence of anime and Shoujo manga began drawing ero-manga with the style of those mediums.  
  
At first, it was a kind of joke... They were supposed to be fooling around, aware they were treading the evil path. Always at the bottom of their hearts, they knew they would become proper professionals and have legitimate manga to draw one day. That's precisely why, despite the sense of shame on both the side of the seller and buyer, there was instead a twisted sense of camaraderie.  
  
And while my love for manga was swept up within that current, I, who was aiming for pure literature, was also silently writing ero-novels with the motif of 'Shoujo' and creating copybooks. The very first Lolicon manga Doujinshi was called 'Cybele', and the written Lolicon magazine I was doing was called 'Youjo Fancier' (幼女嗜好) . **Cybele ([Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B7%E3%83%99%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB_\(%E5%90%8C%E4%BA%BA%E8%AA%8C\)))**  
  
It wasn't until the boom when all the gears started to go crazy. Though I'm speaking severely, young people with neither shame nor shyness began to form lines for Doujinshi that were nothing more than ero-books, and similar ero-Doujinshi began to shoot up like bamboo after it rains.  
  
It was, well, nice. A generation, whose dicks couldn't get it up to the art of Gekiga, encountered a media which excited us for the first time. However, what is strange is the mysterious trend where such base ero-books were misconstrued to be some kind of grand, cutting-edge fashion. Though up until now, this was only possible within the closed Doujin world event local to Tokyo.  
  
Those who pioneered the commercialisation of Lolicon caught the eye of the manga critique magazine for maniacs 'Fusion Product', who featured it in their 1981 October Lolicon special.  
  
In the editorial department, we had the notorious Ootsuka Tooaru (大塚某) and Ogata (緒方 源次郎). On top of that, we had the notorious Takatori Ei (高取英) and Kawamoto Kouji (川本耕次) coming in and out. All the noise generated from that damn ridiculous Lolicon Boom was mostly the work of these four people. **Nowadays Ootsuka goes by Ootsuka Eiji (大塚英志) and Ogata goes by Ogata Katsuhiro (小形克宏).**  
  
For an amateur creator, 'commercial magazines' were things with a colossal appeal no matter the subject. I was bewitched by that appeal and made my debut as a result, so whether it could be regarded as fortunate or unfortunate, the ero-novels I was doing for fun turned into a serious job. I cannot tell for certain whether humanity made a misstep somewhere.  
  
The very first magazine specialising in Bishoujo manga, 'Lemon People', was published in the 57th year of Showa (1982). It all started when a member of the Doujinshi 'Puppet Princess' (人形姫) was introduced to Kuboshoten by Uchiyama Aki. They, too, became professionals for the stuff they were doing half-in-jest and they weren't naïve to that fact. I also seized my opportunity and was in charge of reading articles, and had my first serialisation.  
  
Most of the creators were friends who hanged out with each other prior, and that sense of fellowship was what became the conscious drive to 'liven up the magazine together'. That's how we turned the early issues of 'Lemon People' into a magazine with extraordinary power. However, that eventually resulted in the birth of Nareai; the fact Kubo-san had a plain and absentminded personality also put them in the good graces of the magazine's creators. **Nareai (collusion of mutual interests based on implicit consensus without following the procedures normally taken)**  
  
In addition, we weren't cut off from the Doujinshi world and were treated as 'heroes that came from our family', producing a race of drum-bearers proud to say 'I'm ××-sensei's friend', flattering us with 'Sensei, Sensei'... In this way, we were sheltered from the harsh publishing world by that magazine which was as comfy as a tepid hot spring.  
  
As punishment for their complacency, creators were unable to shed their skin and stopped progressing, even though they had a chance to go major, they lost the strength to simply take advantage of it. This spoiled constitution soon began to dominate the entire industry. The number of infantile creators—hurt, victimised, and insulted just from being spoken to in a slightly harsh manner by editors—increased in number.  
  
What destroyed the monopoly of 'Lemon People' that lasted for 2 years and awoken us from our peaceful dreams was 'Manga Burikko', a magazine by Ootsuka Tooaru released under Byakuya Shobo. After that, 'Melon Comic' (メロンコミック) and Ogata's 'Alice Club', and the many imitation magazines, were born and vanished. Though it's currently booming like the Sengoku period, only the aforementioned constitution has been traditionally inherited. **Manga Burikko ([Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%BC%AB%E7%94%BB%E3%83%96%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%82%B3)); Alice Club (**[**Link**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BB%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%96)**)**  
  
Whatever the magazine, though it may be interesting at first, it will eventually descend into Nareai. Recently, I've been thinking. This industry, the creators, editors, and their miscellaneous feelings as well, are they all consumables?

If there's anyone deserving of the title 'Lolicon Expert', it's this man. If you want books, papers, and other stuff to research in regards to otaku-centric cultural studies, he has them listed in his sources; many rabbit holes for you to tumble down. He goes over every definition of Lolicon, and gives a thorough history. He also did a slide presentation in English, though it's very basic, and his English is weird:

There's way too much anime and manga for a single person to consume. So I generally focus on Kemonomimi-themed stuff, and this guy makes my life so much easier. He also wrote books on Kemonomimi history, which is deeply entangled in the Lolicon (Otaku) sub culture. It's through here I originally learned about the 'Lolicon Boom' many years ago.

Manga Burikko's homepage with all information related to their magazine. The above link is to Nakamori Akio's (中森明夫) columns where he came up with the word Otaku to express his feelings towards the Lolicon readers with a 2D-Complex (二次元コンプレクス). Later, he wrote a book with Eiji, the magazine's editor, about Miyazaki Tsutomu, and that book is where the word Otaku leaked to the mass media.

The Japanese internet is messy and everything is scattered. Some people do useful stuff, and you have to dig to find it through google and the wayback machine. Like the current thing I'm working on translating is scanned from this blog:  

### [La biblioteca de Babel MR.DANDY 129号　昭和57年 11月号](http://felicia44.blog99.fc2.com/blog-entry-41.html)

If you look at the rest of his blog, practically none of it is anime or Otaku related. Just a guy slowly going over old stuff and scanning it for posterity. So it's natural the 1982 magazine he scanned in relation to the Lolicon Bom has a more general audience; its piece on Lolicon is almost essentially 'get a load of these weird dudes drawing porn of Shoujo manga characters as young as 4 years old in commercial magazines'. But it gives the definition of words like Alice Complex, which—until now—I assumed was just an age related complex that would later become the quintessential Lolita to some younger Japanese internet users.

**Like the Fusion Product article, this was published in 1982, way before words like Moe and Otaku existed. Lolicon was the word to describe concepts such as Bishoujo Hentai, Waifu, and so on. The writer has spoken to many important individuals, including Senno Knife (**[**Official Twitter**](https://twitter.com/nekoirutoto)**), who I was already very familiar with before researching these older Mangaka. Kawamoto Kouji, the man who popularised the word Lolita when it comes to Manga, also had some comments worth reading and considering.  
  
Some things that interest me are the actual dialectics between the Hard and Soft Lolicon Manga fans; I've been on the Japanese internet for 2 decades, and haven't really seen the equivalent of such factions online. There's a couple parts I'm unsure about, like one regarding the Disco murderer incident. So I may need to update and fix this translation in the future.**

These days, high school girls are aunties! It's the Lolicon period where the women that move men are between 3~4 years old to middle school. However, why are they so excited over the incest, gangbang, SM, and rape of these small children? Also, their treasures seem to be the red Randoseru and uniforms from elementary school, and dress-up dolls. I have asked the Mangaka and editors involved in the Lolita Boom about this boom.  
  
**■Where Did This Boom Come From?**  
  
"Yaa, Maa-chan's gotten big. (It's been half a year... I'm even touching Maa-chan's bum.)"  
  
"Iyaan, Onii-chan, this isn't... Hurry, hurry, let's go to our room!"  
(Omission)  
"Afu, afu, Onii-chan. P, please don't hurt me... OK?"  
  
"C'mon, Maa-chan, relax your legs."  
  
"Ahh, oww... Onii-chan! It hurts."  
  
"As I thought, it's still impossible."  
  
"Sorry, Onii-chan."  
  
(From Uchiyama Aki's 'Lolicon ABC' Published by Kubo Shoten.)  
  
This is a passage from a 'Lolicon Manga' of the current boom. An extract from Uchiyama Aki's Manga, one of the two great Lolicon Manga authorities. I quickly read one Lolicon work after another. The Lolita introduced were from 3~4 years old to middle school. There was rape, there was incest, there were gangbangs, there was SM (S men and M Lolita), there was defecation and urination, there was Guro. For every pure Lolita, there was a plethora of lewd Lolita. Even pure anime characters meant for elementary schoolers were a source of thrills. If Manga only isn't enough, there's a deluge of real Lolita photo collections. Why have Lolicon gone so far? Hirukogami Ken (蛭児神建), who calls himself a Lolicon miscellaneous writer, says it's a 'Blooming Youth's Young Magazine!'. The Lolicon Doujinshi researcher, Hara Maruta (原丸太), said "'I am a Lolicon' is a means of communication among the youth". But this boom, where did it come from?

**Lolicon ABC by Uchiyama Aki**  
  
**■The Doujinshi that Lit the Fire of Loli Manga**  
  
Around 10 years ago, a Shoujo photobook called 'Europe 12-Year Old Mythology' (Bronze-sha) was published. Afterwards, there were 'Holy Shoujo' (Fuji Art Publishing), Sawatari Hajime's (沢渡朔) 'Shoujo Alice' (Kawade Shobo Shinsha), 'Little Pretenders' (Million Publishing), and various other clothed and nude Bishoujo photobooks were published. The light-type edition of 'Little Pretenders' was published in 1954, but this August, a deluxe edition was released with the subtitle 'Forever'. As time glided by, these sorts of books were gradually being sold. The buying demographic were geezers around their 40s exhausted from work. A portion among them were docile and meek college students. The publishers hadn't the foggiest why these were selling.  
**Bronze-sha (**[**Link**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%96%E3%83%AD%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BA%E6%96%B0%E7%A4%BE)**)  
Kawade Shobo Shinsha ([Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B2%B3%E5%87%BA%E6%9B%B8%E6%88%BF%E6%96%B0%E7%A4%BE))  
Million Publishing ([Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9F%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AA%E3%83%B3%E5%87%BA%E7%89%88))**  
  
'Adult slits are no good, but if it's a child's, then it's permitted. The same slits can be photographed and properly shown, so it sells.' That's the way it's been hypothesised. There were certainly individuals who bought them for that reason. But in reality, it's now thought it's the encapsulation of a portent for something much different.  
  
Around the time this has been happening, the age of talent in the television world has begun to grow younger. If you consider it simply, children were becoming precocious, the heroes and heroines matching them in age were born, and well, while the age-group of the heroine's fans may be of a young demographic, the older demographic were still there.  
  
Hara suspects the appearance of Agnes Lum, or in other words, the appearance of heroines with the bodies of adults and the faces of children were the harbingers of this. But what ultimately (and extravagantly) ignited the Loli Manga Boom was the Doujinshi world.  
  
According to Hara, Japan's first Lolicon magazine was 'Arisu' (愛栗鼠), which was first published in December 1978 (Tokyo・Alice Mania Group・Carroll House Publishing Group). He said it was put in paper bags during Comiket 10 (Comic Market, a comic Doujinshi exhibition and sale site) and sold in secret. It was a little later that 'Cybele', the originator of Lolicon, was first published in April 1979. A special 'Lolita' edition of 'Arisu' was published in April 1979, but neither of those have yet to lead to the boom's arrival. During the summer Comiket 15 of 1980, 'Clarisse Magazine' (Tokyo・Clarisse Magazine Editing Office) appeared, featuring Anime Bishoujo characters without any sexual depictions. The Lolicon magazine 'Lotali' (Tokyo [Chiyoda]・Lotali Club) also appeared, but it was nothing more than a 13 part copy book. Then in the December 1980 issue of Anime magazine 'OUT', the 'Manga Modernology for Sick People・1st Part: Lolita Complex' by Yonezawa Yoshiro (米沢嘉博) was published, and the word leapt forth, marking its first moment in the spotlight. **I should translate the OUT article next, since it kind of ties **Takahashi** Rumiko and Toriyama Akira to the whole Lolicon phenomenon.**  
  
Afterwards, magazines specialising in Lolicon began to be released in the Doujinshi world one after the other.  
  
It's a foregone conclusion the flames would spread to the all-age magazine world. In the world of Shounen Manga, the mainstream is Action. Resulting in epics plus gags. The people who grew tired of such began temporarily dabbling in the world of Shoujo Manga. And the souvenir they brought back was a spiritual and lyrical world. However, in the end, Shoujo Manga wasn't a perfect fit, so what was released for male readers was Lolicon Manga that focused on Bishoujo.  
  
According to Terayama Osamu (寺山修), in the same way the 'virgins and girls, harlots and dolls' in the cosmetic commercial films have become 'free', the 'Bishoujo that 'can be free' has become the mainstream. Of course, Ero-guro, SM, and others of their ilk accompanied them, but according to the editor of the 'Lolicon Complete Work' (Published by Gunyusha), Kawamoto Kouji (川本耕次), those were trends for sadomasochists and perverts. 20 years ago, Seppuku and women in Fundoshi lopping off heads were all the rage, but now the target are Lolicon.  
  
The eroticism in Lolicon was the result of what middle and high school, or good university students who never seen an ero-book, desired, but he says even Ero-gekiga books have taken advantage of the new Lolicon eroticism. You could call this a new area of development. In the Manga world, the world of fantasy, Loli Manga began to escalate in a powerful way——.  
  
Incidentally, the ones who supported Loli Manga were the Anime generation. When it comes to Anime, it's mostly filled with childish characters. According to Shimizu Kazuo (志水 一夫), a researcher of paranormal phenomena, heads that compose a third of one's height garner common feelings of affection and paternality among mammals. Though there's a division of anime with full-scale bodies poking their heads out here and there, the generation who grew up with Anime are unable to leave the nest. According to Hino Youko (火野妖子), a rare female creator of Loli Manga, 'they're clinging to Anime despite themselves growing older'. As a result, their sexual objects have become Anime characters, or to put it simply, young girls, and they've become the important individuals who support Loli Manga. On one hand, the ones with extreme scenes that mostly depict sexual erotica, or rape and SM are called 'Hard Lolicon Manga'. And on the other hand, there's 'Soft'.  
  
In Shounen Manga, these would be the 'Wishy-Washy Manga', the ones that have taken the mentality of Shoujo Manga, but since it's a Shounen magazine, you can't just show the girl getting ploughed. The setting situations are Shounen, so they cannot be Hard. But the same cannot be said for Soft. Most of the genuine Soft exists in the Anime generation. Lolita-chan is their answer. However, there are people who constantly fantasise about these Lolita in their heads and don't even want them to take their clothes off. According to the Mangaka, Senno Knife (千之ナイフ), these guy's rooms are 'completely feminine, covered in girlish things and lacy curtains' as they fervently proceed to self-identify and become one with these Lolita.  
  

![[Pasted image 20250501200541.png]]

  
**Agnes Lum, the Harbinger of Lolicon (?); then again, Lum from Urusei Yatsura was the most popular Lolita in the 1980s, so perhaps it fits.**  
  
**■Concerning Lolita Complex**  
  
We've been saying 'Lolicon' and 'Lolita' for some time now, but what exactly is 'Lolita Complex'? If you trace it all the way back to where it started, you will find it originated in the Soviet Union in 1955.  
  
A soviet writer Vladimir Nabokov published a novel called 'Lolita'. It is a novel where a geezer called Sir Humbert falls in love with a girl called Lolita, but shortly after publication, the names Lolita and Humbert began to be used in clinician reports in the book 'Lolita Complex' by the American psychoanalyst, Russell Trainer. Nabokov says a 'Lolita' needs to be 9~14 years old, and a 'Humbert' (the lover) needs to be at least 10 years older, generally a 30~40 year age difference. Well, if you're a university Lolicon, you could satisfy the 9~14 condition, but if you're a middle schooler, then it would have to be a toddler under 5 years old. However, Lolicon Manga fans and Lolicon really don't care about this sort of definition. The reality is that this is nothing more than a borrowed word. Their definition of 'Lolicon' is really complicated.  
  
There are those who prefer girls on the cusp of becoming adult women, there are those who prefer bona fide girls, and well, there are those who prefer infants. Depending on the age, these types would be classified as Lolicon, Alicon (Alice), and Heicon (Heidi, Girl of the Alps). **I like how it's just Alice; everyone knows what he's talking about.**  
  
According to Senno Knife, you can also separate them by Lolita=Shoujo Harlot and Alice=Shoujo Virgin. And then the aforementioned 'Soft Faction' and Hard Faction' are added. In the magazine that crafted 'Lolicon & Bishoujo Comic' called 'Lemon People' (Amatoria-sha), a 'Lolicon controversy' is unfolding with the Hard and Soft sides arguing with each other and it sounds like their squabble isn't going to end anytime soon.  
  
However, despite such fancies still being fine for middle schoolers, there's something strange about high school and university students going crazy over Anime heroines. Are they charming enough to drive people crazy? You may be thinking how they could be better than a girl who lives in the 3rd dimension you can actually touch, and have her show you her twat-chan that you can have sex with, but——you don't understand. They dislike girls the same age as them (although some have girlfriends their age, these are unprincipled guys from a pure Lolicon's point of view). There is a 'Lolicon Virgin Theory' that both Kawamoto from before and Takakuwa (高桑常寿), the editor of 'Lolicon Hakusho' (Byakuya Shobo) gave their seal of approval and stated 'it's a fact!'.  
  
Takakuwa says this is 'virgin desire mixed with the elements of Mother Complex and so on'. Men who have an inferiority complex when it comes to sex desire girls as a replacement for 'women'. The people who will visit the publisher directly when the bookstore is out of stock. They all seem to have the appearance of 'docile and meek men unable to persuade a woman to go out with them'.  
  
Even in Waseda University, which is hailed as Bankara, they supposedly have a 'Virgin Alliance' and 'Puffed Sleeves Club' (also known as a Sailor Suit fan club). They may be trying to play around and act cool, but perhaps they're putting on a Tatamae mask to camouflage their true parts.  
**Bankara ([Link](https://unseenjapan.com/bankara-meiji-japans-anti-fashion-movement/))**  
  
Kawamoto's stories were much harsher. These Lolicon are very good boys that obediently listen to their mother's instructions with a 'yes, yes'. Heibon Punch and Playboy are both 'Ero Books', so because they shouldn't look at them, they don't look at them. They're serious and delicate, and believe sex itself is a 'sin'! Rather than being unable to keep up with the development of girls their own age, they seem to believe adult women's genitals are weird and gross! However, their body's development is of a healthy and growing boy. So naturally while there is a gap, they don't know how to stretch and express those desires. So they made the genitals of girls pretty. According to Kawamoto's harsh words, they have no choice but to run towards 'violence', 'homo (in execution)', or 'Lolicon (fantasy)'.  
  
**■Why do They Desire Imaginary Shoujo?**  
  
Here's the problem, we know they're into 'girls' so why are they into imaginary girls on paper...? Wouldn't Ito Tsukasa (伊藤つかさ) or Matsumoto Iyo (松本伊代) be good enough targets for them? We need to get to the reason behind this Anime generation. To do that, we must first consider the notion they're a species that has been left behind in the development of normal boys.  
  
For them, a real heroine is too direct. To be real means to be alive. Living women that won't become theirs are hateful and terrifying. So they can safely enter the 2-dimensional world of imaginary heroines. Lolicon are currently saying they have a '2D Complex'. But, you see, there's the opinion that there's no longer truly pure heroines in the television world. In the past, there was Yoshinaga Sayuri-san (吉永小百合), who was a pure enough person, but there's no such heroines like her these days.  
  
The vileness of female high schoolers and middle schoolers has long been exposed. Like the articles in Shoujo magazines, men's magazines say stuff like 'how to tell the OK gestures when a woman is into you', but that's exactly it! The Disco murderer's middle school would've been better off if they had used a contraceptive ring and the girl hid her vulgarity. I believe Burikko coming into fashion is the result of girls instinctively knowing the merits of hiding their true nature. But in the end, Burikko is Burikko, so from the perspective of a pure man, her true nature beneath the mask is transparent. **Burikko ([Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burikko))**  
  
  
**■A World of Delusion, not Fantasy...**  
  
Allow me to introduce you to Hirukogami, a Lolicon miscellaneous writer. One of his quotes.  
  
"It's a mixed mentality of wanting to protect, wanting to care for, wanting to bully, and wanting to attack."  
  
Yeah, I wonder if this is the quintessence of the Hard Lolicon. Looking back on history, 12 year olds were already adults. Indeed, in Ancient Rome, India, Europe, Japan's Heian dynasty, and modern day primitive tribes, all girls got married off at a young age. According to Hirukogami's data, the ideal first sexual experience age is one year after menarche. In other words, the longer the years of education, the longer childhood is extended and the greater the gap between physical perfection and societal oppression. So he says Lolicon is the natural form that transcends that gap. Female university students are completely outside his strike zone.  
  
According to him, 'women are mysterious and unknown', so he's drawn to them. He goes on to say modern women have exposed their raw forms, diminishing their mystique. In the words of one female writer, 'if man knew how women pass the time when they are alone, they'd never marry'. Certainly, that unconscious wisdom worked when women sought comfort and safety under the rule of men requiring they put on a mask to disguise their nature. However, now with female liberation and women earning more money, women have discarded their masks, and this may have spread to middle and high school.  
  
A distrust and disillusionment towards women who no longer give the impression of charm, social oppression. For example, due to the influence of the exam wars and Kyouiku Mama (there's a word called Mamagon, but now that I think about it, that also originated from the Anime world), the desire to return to their fun childhood days is a plus.  
  
Leave things to mothers for the increase in Mothercon that does whatever Mama (Caramel Mama) wants, these guys were only able to love small girls——. Docile, good and gentle young men have become humans broken by the stress of their oppression. The girls they earnestly desire are honest and pure, capable of satisfying a yearning for which they don't understand, a creature shrouded in a mysterious veil like a fairy with a hint of mischief.  
  
However, there's a gap between their own physical desires! Do they actually want to attack these girls? In their books, there are things like 'how to toy with girls', 'little girl sex positions', and 'making little girls drink cock juice', but it's precisely because those things are fiction that they are extreme. The guy who would commit such acts, even from the perspective of his Lolicon buddies, would be called a Hentai and a scumbag. Besides, according to Japanese law, anyone who does any obscene or adulterous act to those under 13, even without coercion or intimidation (meaning, even with consent), will go to prison. Resulting in the 2D world becoming more and more extreme to satisfy these carnal desires. They may subconsciously know what would happen if they do wicked things to girls, turning them into sluts or the nasty girls of these guys who hate sex. This is what Hirukogami has to say. 'It's a delusion, not fantasy, a delusion! It's barren, a barren world'. Even if the basic premise is doing whatever they want with countless girls, it is a 2-dimensional world that won't lead to execution. Beautiful dreams remain beautiful, he's content to violate them merely in his head.

**Image Credit: Mushizuka Mushizou (虫塚虫蔵) (**[**Pixiv Booth**](https://pareorogas.booth.pm/)**). Hirukogami Ken, it's kind of obvious the writer of this column mostly refers to him when he goes on to talk about dolls and such. He's also the only creator here that is adamant about his flat-chest fetish, probably the closest to the incorrect western definition of Lolicon.**  
  
**■The Mangaka Who Created the Boom**  
  
So then, what are the Mangaka gentlemen, who are the actual suppliers, creating in their heads?  
  
One of the two great artists, Uchiyama Aki, is a man who draws adults and then turns them into children. He is the principle of honourable death and no surrender. Since he's no good, he started no good and then attacked. People are forking over their money to buy his stuff, so he has to make it interesting. With the spirit of service, he draws from the perspective 'I'm done flipping skirts' and became like this. Manga doesn't have a direct dialogue with the reader, so the shame that was there at first vanished and escalated. 'Manga, you see, is my excrement'. It's a fantasy world, so you can do whatever is impossible in reality. So the result is I will publish all the weird stuff everyone has lurking at the bottom of their hearts they cannot share outside.  
  
He calls himself 'an ordinary pervert'. Completely normal. When I met Senno Knife who draws worlds with a mean-spirited image, I was shocked. He is a bright and cheerful guy. 'In real life, I prefer older women, so my lover is also older than me,' he says. 'It's a simple docking of the cute characters from Anime and Shoujo Manga into a sensual world,' he goes on.  
  
Now, if a Bishoujo were to appear, then it's Lolicon. My gut instinct says if she were to play, she would play right to the very end. However, 'men of the same generation as me are childish; I feel as if they're trapped as boys'. This person is also normal. The female creator, Hino Youko (火野妖子) is also normal. (Unfortunately, I'm unable to show a photograph of her face. It seems she's hiding the fact she's a Lolicon from her parents. Hirukogami from before says if her parents found out, they would look down upon her. It's hard being a Lolicon.) She says she set her sights on drawing Manga for a school magazine. When she started drawing children, she immediately turned into a Lolicon Mangaka. People who are called Lolicon Mangaka tend to be like that, but when people called her a Lolicon Mangaka, she immediately realised it.  
  
Another of the two great artists, Azuma Hideo, dislikes the term and feels reluctant to describe himself that way. Lolicon-style girls were appearing among his characters since long ago. So he doesn't understand why there's a boom. But when I asked him, he admitted he was a fan of Agnes Chan. And now he's a fan of Wada Akiko. 'Isn't Agnes both motherly and girlish?' A suggestion he received from one of his editors. There's a theory going around that Azuma Hideo is a Mothercon. **Holy shit, the Father of Lolicon was a fan of Agnes Chan, the woman who has built herself a reputation over a decade ago in trying to eradicate Manga Lolicon. Facts are stranger than fiction.**  
  
Senno Knife also says he often hears hate and complaints about mothers from the mouths of Lolicon. Overly noisy mothers, Kyouiku Mama, overprotective mothers. If you flipped them over to their opposite side, then you have the equation for Shoujo.  
  
I heard 'virgin desire' from Uchiyama, but the one saying 'manga is all about having fun' is Hara. "Because if a male virgin desire is genuinely 'my thing', then I wouldn't be able to show the readers rape scenes and sensual scenes of such characters. It's a character I'm exposing to the reader's eyes, so of course they'll play!" This is a sharp point. The Hard phenomenon in the Doujinshi world seems to be simply adapted to the needs of the buyers. Among the 900 to 1000 Doujinshi, I'm told the phantasmic Lolicon magazines that were sold for 300 yen have gone up to 10,000 yen. Among them is a book called 'Catch Me if You Can'. Since Doujinshi folk aren't doing it for the money, so for those that go to Comiket to sell, they find themselves in a situation where they have to sell everything before they can return home. It seems the extreme situation of Doujinshi is that 'Lolicon that suits needs' is getting even 'Harder'. The Manga world is in the end the Manga world, it seems the docking of sensual depictions and Bishoujo of ever decreasing ages from the unexpectedly simple virgin desires into Lolicon Manga by Manga fans who like new things are the true Lolicon. Speaking of which, the Bishoujo nude photobooks also had that element and sucked in the child pornography that were made illegal and video fans in as well.

![[Pasted image 20250501200648.png]]

**(Loli-Loli World) "Uchiyama Aki, is a man who draws adults and then turns them into children."  
The most concise sentence I've seen that describes Lolicon Manga.**  
  
**■Recent Explosion of Girl Lolicon!**  
  
Recently, the number of girl fans has also increased. It seems the phrase 'I'm a Lolicon!' has replaced Burikko and means 'I'm a Bishoujo!', but from the sounds of what they say, their true intentions are 'I also want to be treated like the Shoujo protagonist'. Regarding the Hard, they approve, saying 'that stuff is natural since it's a normal male desire'. Boys who are Lolicon Manga fans are happy thinking 'it's only a fantasy 2D world', yet these girls want such to be recreated in the 3D world via 'I want that to also happen to me!'. Aah, this gap! Men are delicately seeking purity on their desks while women are gunning towards the actual meat.  
  
There's a word for the Lolicon folks are making a fuss about right now. Geezers past their 40s bullying little girls are a different story, but Lolicon haven't even passed the normal love and sex stage. People who cross the line and rape little girls, they're another story. These people have yet to go beyond their world of delusion. They call the executors 'Hentai'. There's also another thing they call 'Hentai', those who aim to identify with Shoujo in the form of 'Soft Lolicon'.  
  
They weren't kidding about Shoujo 'can be free', they have become the Shoujo. They have slipped into the world they yearn for and are remaining there. Buying sailor suits and passing their arms through its sleeves, determined to decorate their room with their Shoujo hobby. Others enter the world of fetishism, collecting panties or stroking red Randoseru. And others become doll fanciers, returning home to play with dolls; there are collectors for many things but their development has turned them into monomaniacs. Collecting all manner of Anime character products (sometimes even wanting to steal from people), buying videos to preserve Anime and the Lolita of commercial films, collecting posters at any cost, and researching their professional affiliation. Nevertheless, this is the desperate proof of their sad existence. But how pitiful it is to live in such a world—!  
  
As Kawamoto says, the 'Hard Faction have normal physical desires, so it's still possible for them to get married. However, for the Soft Faction, once they pop, it's already over for them'. Aah, is there no tomorrow for the Soft? Despite what Hirukogami, Kubo, and Hara said, everyone still has a desire for a pure and innocent childhood. The fact that it is only spontaneously manifesting itself in males is perhaps proof of how strong females are in reality——. Women desire herself to be the Lolita men want, and men desire a woman——a Lolita they can love from the bottom of their hearts. So that's why I believe the Lolita desire is a pure heart hidden in everyone's heart.  
  
However, as the years pass, the body also becomes an adult, and problems such as social responsibilities and feeding oneself manifest themselves. At that time, there are those who smoothly tuck their dear Lolita away in the deep recessives of their hearts (or forget) and turn the key with a *kachari* to lock her up, and there are those who are unable to hide, still swimming in it. The difference I believe seems to be tied to the origins of their Lolita Complex. They are said to be 'lacking the ability to deal with reality', but their inability to cross that line is the modern world and its environment. But if it's at all possible, I would like them to meet good women (which may be difficult and even if they did, I doubt whether these women could love them) and discover a fun 3D world.

> Even in Waseda University, which is hailed as Bankara, they supposedly have a 'Virgin Alliance'

Apparently, Waseda University had an article written about them in Manga Burikko, the Lolicon Manga Magazine where the word Otaku originated, in their September 1982 issue:  

### [大学生をおおうロリコン症候群 | 漫画ブリッコの世界](http://www.burikko.net/people/article01.html)

  
The above is also worth reading, but just to quote a couple passages.  

> June of this year, two months later after the 'Virgin Alliance' was launched, 15 female university students from 12 universities formed their own 'Nice Middle Research Club'. **Nice Middle is slang for a man over 35 years old.**

> "Whenever we enter a Saten (**Kissaten; Tea House**), they fluster over what to order. Anyways, boys these days aren't clear at all. They're indecisive and very stingy. We're ashamed of being from the same generation as them. Unlike them, a nihilistic and lone wolf-type Nice Middle is far more charming. If possible, we would like to have a close relationship with a man like that... that's why we created this club." (Manager Yamamoto Yumiko-san=Pseudonym=Hosei University Literature Department 2nd Year)

> As a result, where did the male students, unable to have an 'equal' relationship with their fellow female students, flee? You guessed it, they found their answer in 'Lolicon' that is experiencing a big boom.

Like the Mr Dandy article, they ultimately blame mothers and Mother Complex on the rise in high school and university boys becoming Lolicon.  

> In some cases where they're always forced to tinker with machines, like the engineering club at Kansai University, a tendency to prefer younger girls who moved at the flick of a switch like a machine appeared.

I feel like the above quote is something to keep in mind in the coming OUT article.

Manga Modernology for Sick People Issue 1: Lolita Complex  
by Yonezawa Yoshihiro (米沢嘉博) ([**Wikipedia**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B1%B3%E6%BE%A4%E5%98%89%E5%8D%9A))  
  
**Yonezawa is the co-founder of Comiket, so he's been in the thick of things when it comes to everything that has happened in the Doujinshi sub culture transpiring in Tokyo. I believe many of his works, including this one, are cited in books and academic papers, though one English paper translated 'sick people' as 'perverts'.**  
  
**This is the beginning of a 14 part series. And for Yonezawa, Lolicon took precedent over the following things he later covered (**[**Monthly OUT Contents**](http://outsite.cool.coocan.jp/out1981.html)**):**  
**1981 Jan: Mecha Fetishism,  
Feb: Homosexualism  
March: Sadism and Masochism Part 1  
April: Sadism and Masochism Part 2  
May: Collector Syndrome

July: Pygmalionism  
August: Triviailism  
September: Mother Complex  
October: Nymphomania  
November: Vulgar Syndrome  
December: Infantile Regression Syndrome and Senile Dementia  
1982 Feb: The Final Syndrome  
  
Lolicon as a Sickness**  
  
In the field of psychopathology, there are people who are only sexually interested in girls between the ages of 3 to 10, known as paedophiles, which is regarded as a mental illness. Lolicon, which is a popular word these days, is a variant of this, but its etymology comes from Vladimir Nabokov's best-selling novel 'Lolita'. It's a story about an intelligent middle-aged man called Humbert Humbert who falls in love with a 13 year-old girl called Lolita, though the contents are about him going mad, it became popular when Stanley Kubrick turned it into a movie. Psychopathologically, when one is unable to have a normal relationship with a normal woman, it is said men will tread the path of turning their attention towards non-sexual 'Shoujo'. Typically, Lolicon is both a curse and compliment thrown towards girl lovers. However, like the mathematician Lewis Carroll who loved girls, when you go for much younger ages called 'Alice Preference', that's when one begins to show signs of danger. Heidi Complex, Heicon, Babycon, Lanacon, Mayucon, Hildacon... Of course, the ones called Maicon and Toucon are slightly different, but somehow, many variants of Lolicon are spreading out. **Lanacon: A Character from Future Boy Conan (未来少年コナン); I can source the others, but it should be obvious they're mostly heroines from various properties.  
  
Lolicon-infested Manga World**  
  
Now then, as the middle-man of this terrible sickness known as Lolicon, the new host, Manga, is attracting attention.  
  
People should have noticed it when men began to say they would look at Shoujo Manga, especially Ako-tan's Otome-chic love comedies. Or if people paid attention when the girls in Eguchi Hisashi's 'Susume! Pirates!!' and Kamogawa Tsubame's 'Macaroni Horensoh' became popular for being cute.  
**Mutsu A-ko (陸奥 A子; [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%99%B8%E5%A5%A5A%E5%AD%90));** **Eguchi Hisashi (江口寿史; [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B1%9F%E5%8F%A3%E5%AF%BF%E5%8F%B2));** **Kamogawa Tsubame (鴨川つばめ; [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%B4%A8%E5%B7%9D%E3%81%A4%E3%81%B0%E3%82%81))**  
  
No, no, we should've used prudence during the pantie-shots in Kanai Tatsuo's 'Izumi-chan Graffiti and when girls began to appear in Yanagisawa Kimio's 'Flying Couple'.  
**Kanai Tatsuo (金井たつお; [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%87%91%E4%BA%95%E3%81%9F%E3%81%A4%E3%81%8A));** **Yanagisawa Kimio (柳沢きみお; [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9F%B3%E6%B2%A2%E3%81%8D%E3%81%BF%E3%81%8A)****)**  
  
But it's too late. Azuma Hideo has been lionised, Takahashi Rumiko's 'Urusei Yatsura' is quite popular, Hosono Fujihiko's 'Sasuga no Sarutobi' is interesting, and Arale-chan from Toriyama Akira's 'Dr. Slump' is NOW creating a sensation. It's far too late.  
**Takahashi Rumiko (高橋留美子; [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AB%98%E6%A9%8B%E7%95%99%E7%BE%8E%E5%AD%90));** **Hosono Fujihiko (細野不二彦; [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B4%B0%E9%87%8E%E4%B8%8D%E4%BA%8C%E5%BD%A6)); Toriyama Akira (鳥山明; [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%B3%A5%E5%B1%B1%E6%98%8E)****)**  
  
Takahashi Yousuke's 'Yoiyamidoori no Bun' and Fujiko Fujio's 'Esper Mami' also had a hand in this. Nakajima Fumio, Muraso Shun, and Uchiyama Aki, the Tankoubon of these so-called third-rate Gekiga technicians sold well. The various Shoujo photobooks, like 'Little Pretenders' and 'Small Fairy', are piling up next to cash registers. The world is now full of Lolicon!!  
**Takahashi Yousuke (高橋葉介; [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AB%98%E6%A9%8B%E8%91%89%E4%BB%8B));** **Fujiko Fujio (藤子不二雄; [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%97%A4%E5%AD%90%E4%B8%8D%E4%BA%8C%E9%9B%84)); Nakajima Fumio (中島史雄; [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%B3%B6%E5%8F%B2%E9%9B%84)); Muraso Shun (村祖俊; [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9D%91%E7%A5%96%E4%BF%8A%E4%B8%80)); Uchiyama Aki (内山亜紀; [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%86%85%E5%B1%B1%E4%BA%9C%E7%B4%80)****)**

**Left→Right: Uchiyama Aki's '気ままな妖精’ and Azuma Hideo's '水底'**  
  
**Manga Introduction for Lolicon**  
  
So, you may be asking 'what's wrong with being a Lolicon'? There's nothing particularly wrong with it, it's only natural for men to be pleased with cute girls in Manga. It's much more proper than becoming a girl and enjoying Shoujo Manga.  
  
However, little by little, your case history will violate you.  
  
**First Stage Symptoms:**  
Begin to grow curious about cute girls in Manga, start chasing after only those sorts of Manga. Your preferences become Otome-chic love comedies by authors like Yuzuki Hikaru, Takahashi Yousuke, Azuma Hideo, and Takahashi Rumiko.  
**Yuzuki Hikaru (弓月光; [Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BC%93%E6%9C%88%E5%85%89))  
  
Second Stage Symptoms:**  
Begin to realise that your own hobbies are Lolicon, start to care more about real girls than the aforementioned Manga by the above. Begin raiding vending machines for 'Shoujo Alice' (released on the 6th of every month), begin collecting 'Little Pretenders' and '12 Year-old Mythology, and even start stealing Hiroko Grace (ひろこグレース) and her friend's posters.  
  
**Third Stage Symptoms:**  
As the sickness worsens, you will start to gather towards like-minded individuals and publish Lolita-centric Doujinshi and talk about girls. You will record those kinds of commercial films by hand and try various things in search of girls. For example, Licca-chan dolls and Junior novels. You cannot see anything other than girls, everything you think about is connected to girls, and then you take action.  
  
If all of that doesn't bother you, then let's take a gander at the Lolicon (?) Manga or Manga that stimulate Lolicon.

![[Pasted image 20250501201124.png]]

**Yuzuki Hikaru: 'エリート狂走曲', 'ボクの初体験', etc...**  
Strong girls and masochist boy's love comedy. It's easy to tell it has many male fans. Bishoujo Rating: B.  
  
**Takahashi Rumiko: 'うる星やつら' and 'ダストスパート'...**  
Boisterous Bishoujo SF Comedy. Rising in popularity; Bishoujo Rating: C.  
  
**Nakajima Fumio: '幼女と少女がもんちっち'...**  
Although he's an Ero-gekiga-type author, this work and 'Monshiro Choucho no Pantsuya-san' (もんしろちょうちょのパンツ屋さん) are exquisite. Bishoujo Rating: B.  
  
**Uchiyama AKi (Noguchi Masayuki): '気ままな妖精'...**  
His whole body of work are Lolicon Ero-Gekiga for Lolicon. Bishoujo Rating: A.  
  
**Azuma Hideo: 'みだれモコ', 'オリンポスのポロン', '純文学シリーズ', etc...**  
Lolicon mania's Idol. The man needs no further introduction; Bishoujo Rating: A.  
  
Besides these folks, there's Wada Shinji (和田慎二) of Alice Mania for Hilda fans, the Shoujo manga by Chiba Tetsuya (ちばてつや), and Kawasaki Sonoko's (川崎苑子) 'Apple Diary' among many others, but works like 'Jurinko Chie' are a matter of taste. If you ever come across a Manga Doujinshi called 'Cybele' at Comiket, buy it; its contamination rate is 90%.  
**Wada Shinji ([Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%92%8C%E7%94%B0%E6%85%8E%E4%BA%8C)); this author is first recorded instance of the word Lolita Complex appearing in Manga in 1974**  
  
The Lolicon germs will begin to spread through these hosts. Although the route of infection remains unclear, eradication is believed to be a distant pipe dream. From what I hear, the only means of escape is to flee to Antarctica.  
  
Well, for that reason, I hope the best for those who are sick and for those who wish to become sick. However, you ought to know beforehand that Lolicon as a hobby and Lolicon as a sickness are fundamentally different. Cause being sick is now in fashion. However, I'll finish this off by saying it's proper for boys to love girls.  
  
Next time, I will stick to the details as I deal with Mecha Fetishism and those who indulge in Mecha.  
  
Well then, I hope you stay well without getting sick. Sorry.

![[Pasted image 20250501201150.png]]

**Page 121 of Wada Shinji's manga with the earliest known instance of Lolita Complex being used. According to the owner of 'Pepe' (ぺぺ), the abbreviation 'Lolicon' first appeared in an issue of the underground Lolicon magazine Candy (キャンディ; not to be confused with another magazine in the 1980s) in the late 1970s. However, it's an underground magazine, so it's probably difficult, or impossible, to verify this.  
  
It's also kind of funny Yonezawa would rate Rumiko as a C when she would later become the richest woman in Japan thanks to her story-telling and Bishoujo (Lolita) having the strongest appeal overseas. I sometimes type Azuma Hideo's name into Youtube to see if someone, anyone, is going to do a proper video about him in English, and this year, I did finally find a short video about Azuma Hideo, and it's by someone obsessed with Takahashi Rumiko who was doing pieces on the mangaka connected to her, and of course, the video creator mistakenly treated Rumiko's presence as being one of greater influence on Azuma when it's more complicated than that as one can see with the above when Yonezawa just treated Rumiko as a rising star gaining popularity, and Azuma as a big deal with no need for further introduction. In a later issue of OUT, Yonezawa interviewed Azuma Hideo, and they both recommended people read works by 'Tori Miki' (とり・みき;** [**Link**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%A8%E3%82%8A%E3%83%BB%E3%81%BF%E3%81%8D)**).  
  
I'm still on the fence about whether Yonezawa is being facetious about his stages of development in Lolicon. Well, this is in 1980, so the number of people who would've developed what would be known as a 2D Complex would be few and far between with most older individuals still expressing an interest in idols and talents. Heidi Complex has always been treated as a joke by Japanese Lolicon fans with the old fans calling fans of such Byouki (sick) and modern day Lolicon calling those types of characters 'ペドい' (Paedoi), insisting they're not Loli.

**Yonezawa decided to write this 2 years after the above when it became clear to him that 2D-Complex was a thing developing among the Japanese Anime and Manga fandom. The last part gives his own timeline for the Lolicon Boom that can be compared to the timeline by Hirukogami Ken in Lolicon Kiss and Mekata Kairi in Mr. Dandy.  
  
Let's Talk About the Lolicon Boom——We Like Cute Girls. But Think About It——Don't You Find Lolicon as a Fashion to be Twisted?**  
by Yonezawa Yoshihiro (米沢嘉博)  
  
**_Right now, the Lolicon Boom is at its peak in our society. And it seems the mass media has taken advantage of this Lolicon Boom to do various things. However, wait a sec, isn't it strange Lolicon have begun to prance around triumphantly? So says Yonezawa Yoshihiro. Yonezawa, who is said to be the man who spread the sickness known as Lolicon into our society, will critique the attitude of the current boom that is running in a twisted direction!_  
  
■Bishoujo Characters Make Me Happy, But...**  
  
I think it's only natural for Shoujo to appear in Shoujo Manga, and even in Shounen Manga, where most of the protagonists are Shounen, it's natural for Shoujo to appear as companions. Of course, most Anime is made for children, so it's completely natural Shounen and Shoujo are the protagonists. In other words, no matter what anyone says, things like Manga and Anime are the worlds of Shounen and Shoujo.  
  
Essentially, Anime and Manga are centred around Shounen and Shoujo. So, there's nothing significant about the Shounen and Shoujo being charming, is there? Well, so long as it isn't a parody, the heroes and heroines will try to create an image most humans will find to be charming. In this way, Anime and Manga are drawn full of cool and charming heroes, and cute and beautiful heroines. You get what I'm saying? Simply put, it's easy to find images of cute girls that suit your preference in Manga or Anime. By the same token, it's easy to find the image of your ideal hero. In reality, finding such individuals would prove to be extremely difficult. Look around you, nothing but pigs and pig-ugly guys. So perhaps it's better for our mental health if we turn our attentions to the ideal 2D lovers found in Manga or Anime.  
  
Though it appears Shoujo Manga were the early worms when it came to drawing charming Shounen as their protagonists, Shounen Manga has also pushed charming Shoujo to its fore. When a girl says Oscar or Gilbert, all the boys around her cannot help but lose. It's for this reason people started paying attention to the Bishoujo in Shounen Manga. Izumi-chan and her pantie-shots and Kei-chan from 'Flying Couple' (翔んだカップル) being quite popular.  
  
Because of that, when we see a Bishoujo in Manga and say she's cute, the word we get branded with is 'Lolicon'. Carrying with it a completely different meaning from middle-age geezers attracted to young girls, 'Lolicon' has begun to make a stir. Simply saying a Bishoujo from a Manga or Anime is cute is enough for people to respond, 'You're a Lolicon!'.  
  
That's because the cute Shoujo drawn in Manga and Anime are drawn with the intention to be cute and loved by everyone, so many people believing they're 'oh so cute—' is simply the creator hitting their mark, nothing short of a job well done. If everyone thinks the girl the creator drew is 'cute', then it's not the reader's fault, it's the creator's ability to hit the right wavelength.  
  
It feels good looking at cute girls, and whenever a Bishoujo we think is cute appears in Manga or Anime, it makes us happy. There's nothing really wrong with welcoming such trends. I believe it's proper to put effort into the artform of girls and character creation.  
  
However, if you put your body and soul into it and get absorbed in Lolicon play, then it may become a bit of a problem. Because, in the end, these girls can only live in fiction. And even there, just barely.

■In Valuing Psuedo-Stimulation**  
  
So, if there was a problem, I believe it may be in our way of reading or our reading of the work. Or it may be a problem of the reader's perceptions and way of life extending all the way to their reading of the world beyond Manga or Anime. What are Manga and Anime? Speaking journalistically, they're forms of mass entertainment, but that's not really saying much. For us, no, for our readers, what is Manga and Anime? Let's begin there.  
  
Truth be told, they're pseudo-realms of fiction. No matter how much they depict reality and how realistically they progress, no matter how moved or immersed we are in those worlds, they're fictional worlds that don't exist anywhere in reality.  
  
The stimulation we taste from looking at Manga and Anime is nothing more than pseudo-stimulation. The thrills, excitement, and laughter are from another world that exists on paper or cathode-ray tubes. That's the way fiction has always been. In the worlds we fabricated, we sympathise with the protagonists, and enjoy and are emphatically moved by their adventures, battles, and romances.  
  
For those living in a dull, not-so-interesting life where we need to take great care in how we live, fiction gives us the joy of living in another world to forget our daily lives for a moment. Everything we call mass entertainment has this element. Fiction has the power to refresh our moods to try living our daily lives once more.  
  
Of course, that's not all. They have the power to let us experience other worlds so we can see our current world with different eyes. If we experience a utopia in fiction, then we can begin to think about the form of reality we ourselves live in afterwards. If we see a living hell, then we can think about not wanting to live in such a world.  
  
If we sigh at the beautiful lovers on the silver screen, then we will yearn for such love. However, no matter how their story develops in their everyday world, even if it uses realistic details, they're nothing more than fictional worlds. Because the sender is merely creating 'objects' to impress, excite, and charm the receiver.  
  
Do you get what I'm saying? However, it feels as though the difference between the pseudo-experience of fiction and the weight of actual experience are vanishing before our very eyes. It's fine to make the fictional emotions our own, but it feels like we're giving priority to those emotions that give us comfort.  
  
Let's return to the beginning of our discussion. Simply put, because the Shounen and Shoujo in fiction feel cool and cute, it might be dangerous if we place too much importance on those things.  
  
Well, girls being cute is nice, so it's natural we like things that make us feel good and it's understandable experiences that are exciting and thrilling are wonderful. However, I don't believe feeling in the body and knowing in the head are comparable to the same dimension. Physical, physical... I don't mean to sing, but the experiences of Anime and Manga are pseudo-experiences; it goes without saying the fact the characters drawn in them don't exist anywhere is a prerequisite for our enjoyment of fiction.  
  
There may be nothing but dark and light people in our society, but the darkness includes all the heavy, difficult, and tiresome things as well. And the light is 'ah, light', it seems. It probably doesn't exist. This is the relationship between reality and fiction. Everyday life is dark, pseudo-experience is light. Perhaps you're getting my point.  
  
However, should the fictional world be cherished so dearly? We mustn't waste our everyday lives, and besides, this peaceful life we live is unexpectedly uncertain. For starters, in our everyday life, we can talk about pseudo-worlds and other worlds.

![[Pasted image 20250501201426.png]]

**■Concentrating on Society and Our World**  
  
Well, anyways, I won't deny the importance of living through pseudo-experience found in Manga, Anime, or TV, but those things kinda feel like being stuck inside a capsule. Expelling annoying stuff like interacting with people and having a relationship with the world, clinging to the things you like is nothing more than crawling inside your own, personal capsule.  
  
——Ack, the topic has deviated from Lolicon. Let's see, discovering a Bishoujo that suits your tastes in Manga or Anime is great. Turning those Bishoujo into fan-fiction with nudes and parodies, so long as it's interesting, is also great. No one really has the right to complain about those things. The power of Manga and Anime is that they can be enjoyed that way, so that's why we find enjoyment in Doujin activities.  
  
However, the Lolicon that's currently experiencing a boom feels a little different to me. I believe saying 'I'm a Lolicon!' so brightly and energetically is strange. Normally, such behaviour would be met with scorn.  
  
It still doesn't matter if she's a real Bishoujo. If you're in your 40s or 50s, there may possibly be a problem, but whatever, it's fine. However, there's nothing good about shouting that you're passionate about the Bishoujo depicted in the art of Manga or Anime. I still get the point of cherishing your feelings of having discovered the cuteness and beauty in those characters, but it's still 'embarrassing' to make a mere drawing or the character themselves into an object of predilection. Even more so to publicise it.  
  
Furthermore, this reverse-discrimination where you reject those who aren't Lolicon, the escalation where everyone needs to prove 'how much of a Lolicon they are' to their Lolicon buddies makes me, after all, want to say 'wait a minute!'.  
  
"Liking this sorta stuff, you must be a Lolicon."  
  
"N, no, it's not like that!"  
  
——These are the normal reactions. There's nothing wrong at all about having a Bishoujo desire and Lolicon tendencies. We can still enjoy those things in our Manga and Anime.  
  
Riding on the Lolicon Boom, it's a good thing the girls have gotten cuter, and it's acceptable that Shoujo itself is making an appearance in Manga and Anime as a theme. And it's a good thing for readers to discover in themselves the things they yearn for, we must know ourselves.  
  
There may be incredible potential in incorporating such play in your life. ——However, if you escalate your play by sticking to Lolicon, it'll transcend mere hobby and fashion and become something twisted. Even excluding that, Lolicon as a fashion makes me imagine twisted situations.  
  
Having no perspective where you can examine yourself objectively, your personal point-of-view will be to cancel your relationship with the world and retreat into a capsule. It'll be an age of capsulism, an age of immature individualism.  
  
To put it simply, I believe we need to examine our society and the world more closely and what it means to know ourselves, we need to consider our place in humanity's perennial homework. Otherwise, we won't be able to get along well with people, and we won't be able to come to terms with reality. If the daily lives we live in worsen, we won't be able to enjoy fiction or even have spare time to fantasise. That's why.

**■The Flow and State of the Lolicon Boom**  
  
The term 'Lolita Complex' first became popular around the middle of the 1960s. It became established as a psychoanalytical term in America, and two or three years later, it came to be used in Japan as well.  
  
In 1972, 'Europe 12 Year-old Mythology' (Kenmochi Kazuo; 剣持加津夫) was published, and while it was the forerunner of the Shoujo nude photobooks which became popular, it had no successor. However, as part of a reassessment of Lewis Carroll, a small 'Alice' boom occurred. This was around when Sawatari Hajime (沢渡朔) released his photobook called 'Shoujo Alice'.  
  
And in 1978, there was a Shoujo nude mook called 'Little Pretenders' that sold explosively, so Shoujo photobooks took advantage of its popularity and appeared one after the other. Then in 1979, the specialty magazine (?) 'Shoujo Alice' was launched from a vending machine book publisher called Alice Publishing, and in the following years, Azuma Hideo's 'Pure Literature' (純文学) series began their serialisation. And this year, they're doing an 'Alice Special' in Alice Publishing's 'Groupie' (グルーピー).  
  
In the Doujinshi world centred in Comiket, Doujinshi called 'Youjo Fancier' and 'Cybele', if anything, eked out sales. However, that year, meaning in 1980, Noguchi Masayuki (Uchiyama Aki) was selling mainly third-rate Gekiga. And even 'Erogenica' (エロジェニカ) was leaning towards mainly Bishoujo.  
  
Continuing from the previous year, Azuma Hideo's popularity had been on the rise, and Shounen Manga weekly magazines saw an increase in Manga featuring cute girls. The 'Shounen Sunday' lineup being the most prominent.  
  
By the end of 1980, 'Lolita Complex' was brought up in 'Manga Modernology for Sick People', and it surged into the extraordinary popularity of 'Cybele' in the winter Comiket. Around this time, 'Clarisse Magazine' was gaining popularity. ——It appeared as if everything prior was in preparation for 1980.  
  
Of course, one mustn't forget the popularity of Clarisse and Lana among Anime fans, and the introduction of Bishoujo characters in Anime parodies increasing as well. Perhaps the reason for this may be the ratio of Manga and Anime fans gradually changing from female to male.  
  
And then the 'Lolicon' boom began smack dab in the centre of the 1981 Doujinshi world. In the spring and summer Comiket, Doujinshi aimed at Lolicon rapidly increased with the rise of male fans. Fan magazines, like 'OUT' and 'Animec' began to often feature Bishoujo characters, and the word 'Lolicon' became a common word among Manga and Anime fans.  
  
Which brings us here, Adachi Mitsuru (あだち充) is increasing in popularity mainly through 'Miyuki', and Takahashi Rumiko (高橋留美子), Hosono Fujihiko (細野不二彦), Shibata Masahiro (柴田昌宏), and other Mangaka are gaining popularity drawing cute girls, and magazines labelled as Lolita and Bishoujo are being introduced among third-rate Gekiga magazines. The number of magazines serialising Uchiyama Aki's works are increasing and magazines like 'Young Kiss' are being published.  
  
In October 1981, the Manga information magazine 'Fusion Product' did a 'Lolita/Bishoujo Special Edition'. The special edition—that included Bishoujo characters, Lolicon Doujinshi, maps, and a roundtable talk—was well-received and the word 'Lolicon' began to fly around more than ever before.  
  
Separating from the former word known as 'Lolita Complex', a truly light and beautiful new term known as 'Lolicon' was born. 'Lolicon' has been taken up by TV and weekly magazines, and 'Asahi Shimbun' (朝日新聞) recorded the emergence of the Lolicon Tribe as is their custom in 1981.  
  
And this boom-like phenomenon, showing no sign of abatement, encouraged the launch of the Lolicon Manga magazine known as 'Lemon People' (Amatoria-sha), and its waves are reaching even major publishers. The first being 'Apple Pie' (アップル・パイ) published by Tokuma Shoten.  
  
From this form of new 'play' for Manga and Anime fans, there's no telling how it will be incorporated into a commercial base, but I heard that Uchiyama Aki's 'Andoro Trio' (あんどろトリオ) released in 'Shounen Champion' is #1 in their popularity poll. Along with that, it seems his Tankoubon have also begun to be reprinted one after the other.  
  
Adachi Mitsuru's Tankoubon are also selling as incredibly well as ever, the 'Lolicon Boom' that is happening in the Manga and Anime world has meant the re-evaluation of Bishoujo characters, and the restoration of male fans as well. It's not a bad thing at all for the charm of Bishoujo featured in these works to attract attention in Shounen Manga.  
  
However, the current situation is that there are no new Bishoujo characters among Anime characters. In addition to the fixation on techniques where you'll be accepted so long as you deliver cute girls and eroticism. No matter how you slice it, it's not a bright ingredient for the future.  
  
Since the moment the word called Lolicon began to take a life of its own, it ceased being a 'sickness' in its original sense, and instead became more like a 'hobby or trend'. In addition to being a 'tool' for play. It wouldn't have experienced a boom otherwise. ——Everyone is searching for lost words...  
  

**Unless I find something else related to Fusion Product. I believe any articles I translate would just be in relation to the topics and people presented in these five articles.**  
  

> Hirukokami: "I'm still a long ways from that."  
> Hayasaka: "You'll need to seclude yourself in the mountains with a Randoseru for about three years (laughs)."

**In the Fusion Product Roundtable Talk, Hayasaka Miki told Hirukogami Ken he needs to seclude himself in the mountains with a Randoseru, and much like Azuma Hideo, Hirukogami had his own disappearance, causing his friends and work acquaintances to wonder what happened to him (i.e. did he commit suicide). And as it turns out, he really did 'seclude himself in the mountains' by becoming a monk, changing his name and everything. **Ootsuka Eiji, the editor of Manga Burikko, did a piece on Hirukogami's departure.****  

> **Wada Shinji ([Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%92%8C%E7%94%B0%E6%85%8E%E4%BA%8C)); this author is first recorded instance of the word Lolita Complex appearing in Manga in 1974**

**While doing research, I found this digital paper with sources that was very informative about Lewis Carroll and Alice in Wonderland as it is related to Japan:**  
[**Fixing the Image of 'Lewis Carroll=Lolita Complex' Under Japanese Sub Culture (Click)**](http://www.hp-alice.com/lcj/subculture.html)  
**Things I learned from the above:**  
**1) A book in Japanese about the man behind Lewis Carroll was released around 1968~1969.  
2) This book started a myth about Lewis Carroll proposing marriage to a 13 Year Old Alice Liddell that has been treated as uncontested common knowledge ever since in Japan.  
3) Lewis Carroll became the poster-child of Lolita Complex, so when Wada Shinji did a Alice in Wonderland parody in 1974, the character playing as Lewis Carroll is accused of being a Lolita Complex.**  
**4) In 1975, Alice in Wonderland was retranslated by Kadokawa, and the translator had commentary about the author that included the 13 Year Old Marriage Proposal myth.  
  
It puts some perspective on the whole Alice-mania in Japan and stuff like 'Shoujo Alice' by Sawatari Hajime (he's a famous Japanese photographer who went to London to create a photobook that included erotic nudes of an 'Alice' that was paraded around Japanese newspapers as high art; everyone who lived through this period looking back at this still find it unbelievable something like that was published and heralded without any backlash).**

**This manga was one of the few all-age manga Uchiyama Aki published. It was being serialised alongside Tezuka Osamu's serial, and according to Taniguchi Kei, both Uchiyama and Tezuka would include references to each other's mangas and would trade words with each other at company dinner parties at Akita Shoten.**

Just be aware that the 6 volumes of 'Comic Shingenjitsu' are different from the 5 volumes of the regular 'Shingenjitsu' Eiji published earlier. I would only recommend acquiring the latter if your reading level is above and beyond a regular Japanese citizen; a common complaint is that Eiji is not an easy read and even for me, I'm not skilled enough to properly translate his writings. Comic Shingenjitsu is also mentioned on the Manga Burikko homepage, since that's Eiji's pet project (**[**Link**](http://www.burikko.net/comic-%E6%96%B0%E7%8F%BE%E5%AE%9F%E3%80%80vol-4%E3%81%AE%E5%86%85%E5%AE%B9%E3%81%AF.html)**).**  
  
**Special Edition: The Spiritual History of True Otaku (Bibliographical Introduction)**  
  
**By Ootsuka Eiji (大塚英志)**  
  
Starting here, over the next three issues, we will be publishing the 'personal history' of Hirukogami Ken——or rather the priest who was once called Hirukogami Ken.  
  
Explaining Hirukogami Ken is, in some sense, more difficult than explaining Azuma Hideo. At the same time, his name has been more forgotten than Azuma Hideo. If one were to suggest those who unilaterally shouldered the barrenness and difficulties of those days, Hirukogami Ken is the only one comparable to Azuma Hideo; furthermore, it is my opinion his sacrifice was much more extreme.  
  
If you were to flip through the pages again, you'll notice a character wearing sunglasses, a white coat, and a cap sometimes appearing in Azuma Hideo's works from the 1980s. Before 'Otaku' became public, this character that exhibited the public image of a 'Proto-Otaku' as a 'degenerate' is Hirukogami Ken.  
  
In fact, he showed up at events like Comiket wearing such an outfit. He himself has already spoken about how he committed to the origins of 'Lolicon Manga' in the Doujinshi and publishing worlds, so I won't repeat that here. However, when trying to make those sorts of expressions public, I recall him being reasonably self-aware that he will naturally be under public scrutiny, so he dressed himself in such an outfit in advance.  
  
On one hand, it's not light enough to be called 'Cosplay' and it's too risky to his personal well-being to be called 'parody', but on the other hand, it would still be problematic to dismiss it as 'masochism' or 'boasting of his own faults'. He was a being even I didn't want to look at directly. However, it's proof his strange appearance turned into the faintest critique of his contemporaries. It should be noted that before Nakamori Akio (中森明夫) caricatured the people who gathered at Comiket from outside with the word 'Otaku', Hirukogami Ken's disguise was already a 'critique' of himself being an Otaku. Even for me, his disguise was distressing enough I couldn't help but avert my eyes. Hence why the only vague memory I have of him, either the day Kagami (かがみ) passed away or the day afterwards, was the moment I passed by him somewhere in Byakuya Shobo (白夜書房) and exchanged a greeting that was neither a bow nor a nod.  
**Kagami Akira (かがみ あきら) ([Link](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%8B%E3%81%8C%E3%81%BF%E3%81%82%E3%81%8D%E3%82%89))**  
  
The Genesis Lolicon/Bishoujo Manga creators that gathered towards Azuma Hideo had no choice but to fade out in the form of being devoured by the following generations (generally the delicious parts of new genres and styles are entirely kidnapped by the groups that come around two generations afterwards). Among them, the disappearance of Hirukogami Ken puzzled us in a way that was different from that of Azuma Hideo. At some point in time, rumours circulated, like an urban legend, that Hirukogami Ken had left home to become a priest. They sounded too good to be true, and to be honest, I didn't believe them, but every time he was mentioned, someone would say he left home and became a priest; however, no one knew where the rumours originated. Certainly, that outfit of his spoke volumes about the depths of karma in his 'Otaku expression', but since it was a part of him he unilaterally shouldered, saying he left home to become a priest was taken as a joke that was too good to be true. However, there was perhaps a selfish desire among his contemporaries that would allow at least one person to live that way.  
  
That being said, if I hadn't started 'Comic Shingenjitsu', my memory of him would remain in my mind simply as an episode of an urban legend.  
  
However, in the previous issue when I visited Azuma Hideo for the first time since returning from his second disappearance, Hirukogami's name unexpectedly came up. Suddenly, a letter arrived saying it was alright to make copies and show others. Indeed, it was difficult to simply look upon the author of 'Disappearance Diary' (失踪日記) before my eyes, but I was reunited with the 'current' Hirukogami Ken without time to prepare my heart. In the letter, the name was different from his old name, it was his name as a priest.  
  
Meaning he actually left home to become a priest. It wasn't an urban legend. And when I read that Kagami's death was one of the decisive reasons for his own fade-out, everything rang true.  
  
I almost 'suicided' my magazine in the wake of Kagami's death (nevertheless, I announced a suspension of publication without permission which became a big issue with the agency). I believe I was driven by feelings I cannot be here any longer. Furthermore, anywhere that wasn't here, no specific place, aah, it was a sense of resignation and determination that I must be getting old.  
  
I'm aware some creators still resent me for trying to 'suicide' the magazine. However, the matter of both me and them staying 'here' forever is also my way of accepting Kagami's death.  
  
Hirukogami Ken wasn't directly involved with my magazine, but the 'Lolicon Manga magazine' that was almost a joke project sold like crazy, and as the colours of the eyes of the publishers and the people gathered there changed, Kagami died and taught us in the tides of opportunity that 'jokes' have their limits.  
  
Hirukogami Ken also 'left' that place after Kagami's death, but he literally left it to become a priest. Suffice it to say, it would've made sense back in those silly days.  
  
The originals of his private letters will be serialised in the coming three issues from this one, written at the recommendation of Azuma Hideo. After we published the previous issue, the letter reached me. Azuma Hideo wrote him in recommendation that he write. After reading through them, I thought I had no choice but to publish them.  
  
One is, of course, a testimony of the times. The testimonies of the parties concerned regarding the prime origin of 'Moe' are extremely important as primary sources. When I wrote 'Spiritual History of Otaku', I wrote that with the desire to see a number of testimonies about my contemporaries, but so far, none have come out. In that sense, there's value in making them public. As I wrote in the afterword of my book, it would be problematic if that book became the 'official history'. However, more than that, I felt those who lived during that period had a responsibility to accept his way of life in his later years.  
  
Some young writers don't appreciate the fact I read Azuma Hideo's 'Disappearance Diary' in the memory of my contemporaries, but that is just an excuse for their failure to accept what they should have accepted even in their own time. Even in their own time, there should be people who lived like Azuma Hideo and Hirukogami Ken.  
  
I'll reiterate, whether you find Azuma Hideo or Hirukogami Ken disappearing or leaving home to become a priest to be facts that are 'funny', or even if you try lifting the facts themselves, there's no meaning in it. Even if it's 'funny', the unfunny parts still remain.  
  
The important thing is to not avert your eyes from the points where their words and existence are thrown out. Of course, readers may simply reach out to them out of curiosity just for 'fun', but in that respect, they are far more skilled in 'art' than in 'literature'. However, just because it's funny doesn't mean you'll be forgiven, so something like a difficult sediment will remain within you. Stances of 'amusement' or 'critique' are ultimately nothing more than flinching at foreign objects, so it's important to simply flinch and swallow their carefree lives with the sediment.  
  
The sediments that are swallowed will one day become their words within each reader. And——. I don't care about the rest. They say Hirukogami Ken sometimes acts as a begging priest in the crowd, so if you see a begging priest in the crowd, I don't care if it's him or not, donate some change from your pocket. For now, let's pray for world peace out of respect for him who loves Mother Theresa.  
  
Hirukogami Ken laughingly said that some Yakuza had trouble collecting money by making foreigners dress up as priests, but even if you bow your head to a fake priest, I believe it's not a bad way to pray.  

**It's interesting that Kagami Akira was never mentioned in any of the previous articles in this thread. For anyone that is a fan of mecha anime, particularly the kind that feature cute girls and mechs, Kagami Akira was a huge influence, but sadly passed away at the age of 26, only achieving 2~3 years of professional work. It's unfortunate he still doesn't have an English Wikipedia page dedicated to him. Ootsuka Eiji dedicated the first volume of Comic Shingenjitsu to Kagami Akira, since he was an important figure in his Manga Burikko Lolicon magazine.**

'The Tsukuru' is a magazine that values freedom of speech and expression, and offers articles about various industries one wouldn't find in the mass media. Their early issues are sparse on photos or illustrations, but this article by Takatori Ei, a man who used to work as the third editor-in-chief of Erogenica, the magazine Taniguchi Kei debuted, offers its own flavoured perspective on the Lolicon Boom. It introduces many more names and focuses on certain individuals more clearly, making it a good starting point to getting to properly understand the kind of hostile environment creators like Hirokugami Ken will find themselves in before their fade-outs.

**The Masterminds of the 'Lolicon Boom' Over the Youth**​

**By Takatori Ei (高取英) (**[**Wikipedia**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AB%98%E5%8F%96%E8%8B%B1)**) (**[**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/takatoriei/with_replies)**)** ***Current Status: Deceased (2018)**  
  
**■The Majority of Lolicon Students are Virgins**  
  
Currently, it is said 'Lolicon' is growing popular among the youth.  
  
Since the publication of Vladimir Nabokov's novel 'Lolita', the term Lolita Complex had been psychologically established as an indicator towards a certain sexual proclivity. Nakobov's novel 'Lolita', released in 1955, is a work in which a middle-aged man, Humbert Humbert, is seduced by the sexual charm of a 12 year-old Bishoujo, Lolita.  
  
The Lolicon that is currently booming among the Japanese youth is not like the novel where a middle-aged man embraces a girl. It's a much softer boom, in fact, it refers to the proclivity towards loving Bishoujo found in photographs and Manga, that has come to be called a '2D Complex', rather than real girls.  
  
If you were to translate the word Lolicon, then it would be Bishoujo Fancier or Bishoujo Preference. Of course, what's supporting the boom are imaginary girls, so realistically speaking, they're nothing more than objects treated as an onanism pet. A platonic love towards the Bishoujo in photographs, Anime, and Manga composes the Lolicon that is popular among the current youth.  
  
That is to say, the Lolicon that is in vogue is an idea that mainly includes the elements of a game.  
  
The 'Lolicon Complete Works' (ロリコン大全集) (Gunyusha Publishing; Toshi to Seikatsusha Release) is a Tankoubon that acts as a compilation for the youth of the Lolicon Boom. Its first edition of 23,000 copies sold out, and currently 40,000 copies are in print.  
  
This book was edited by Kawamoto Kouji (Age 29), who acted as the editor-in-chief of the vending machine magazine 'Shoujo Alice' from 1980~1981.  
  
The first editor-in-chief of 'Shoujo Alice' was Komukai Hitomi (小向一実), who was also the president of Alice Publishing at the time. Soon after, Kawamoto Kouji became editor-in-chief, and was in charge of editing 'Kannou Gekiga' (官能劇画) and 'Monthly Peke' (月刊Peke) at Minori Publishing.  
  
The 'Lolicon Complete Works' is a collection of Lolicon works chosen by Kawamoto Kouji.  
He succeeded in getting Hideo Azuma, whom he had known during his days as a Manga editor, to draw erotic Bishoujo Manga.  
  
Hideo Azuma is a cult figure with enthusiastic fans, and a Mangaka who has won the SF Nebula Award in the Manga category. Hideo Azuma, who was a fan of Hayashi Hiroko (林寛子) and Agnes Chan (アグネス・チャン), serialised Bishoujo Manga in 'Shoujo Alice', and received passionate support from Lolicon Manga fans.  
  
A quote from Kawamoto.  
  
"It's not just Azuma-san, even exceptional Mangaka like Fujiko Fujio (藤子不二雄) and Tezuka Osamu (手塚治虫) have a Lolicon disposition. Manga is a moratorium. The current youth continue to read Manga cause none of them want to grow up. Since Manga-mania are moratorium humans*****, for them sex equals Lolicon. University students are Mothercon when they enter and become Lolicon when they graduate. Due to them being raised in co-education from a young age, they hold no admiration for women of their generation. When you do co-ed, you get disillusioned to insolent women. Most Lolicon students are virgins. Since women are realistic, they seek permanent employment (marriage), but men are becoming romantic. In fact, they're starting to desire elementary schoolers that cannot have sex as a dream."  
**※T/L Note: Moratorium Human (モラトリアム人間) is used to describe young people who find it difficult to adjust themselves to an adult world.**  
  
When co-education was introduced in 1948, boy students were thrilled to sit side by side with the girls they pined for. Ishizawa Youjirou (石坂洋次郎) depicts a love letter incident in 'Blue Mountain Range' (青い山脈), turning the heartwarming co-ed episode into a novel.  
  
Its theme song of both avalanches disappearing and flowers blooming to a bright, young singing voice, over time, was sung as if we take hands in a folk dance, it will smell sweetly of black hair in 'High School Third Year' (高校三年生) by Funaki Kazuo (舟木一夫).  
  
In the movie 'Blue Mountain Range', it depicted Shinko also shouting back to the confession of the male student shouting 'I love Shinko-san—!' with 'I also love Rokusuke-san—!'.  
  
In the movie 'High School Third Year' publicly released in 1963, high schoolers by the names of Kuraishi Isao and Sugata Michiko were depicted in a scene where they kissed by the riverbed.  
  
The love hymns of co-education ends here.  
  
In 1973, the third year middle schooler Yamaguchi Momoe sang 'whatever you wish, I'll do anything' and straightly expressed her desire in 'Blue Fruit' (青い果実). You would suppose male students of the same generation being pressed down by the entrance exam wars being what's worsening the relationships between men and women, but on the contrary, it is believed Yamaguchi Momoe suggestively sang the mentality of female students, ashamed of their virginity, leaping towards sexual adventures. Yamaguchi Momoe sang 'I'll give you a girl's most precious thing' in 'One Summer's Experience’ (ひと夏の経験) and 'his voice is different, his age is different, his dreams are different. His moles are different. Forgive me, I’m comparing him again with my last year boy' (Imitation Gold). Later she begins to sing, 'you only embrace me or not according to your mood. After all, a woman always waits. Boy, where the heck did those ideas came from?' (Play Back Part II).  
  
A magazine for high school girls writes '16 years old is a sexually experienced age', and in comparison, boys, unable to fall in love, must have grown addicted to their onanism pet (2D Complex).  
  
When speaking of the Lolicon Boom, even including Ito Tsukasa (伊藤つかさ) and Matsumoto Iyo (松本伊代), the mass media calls them Lolicon. However, it is quite normal for university students to yearn to be high school stars.  
  
With the succession of high teen idol singers, it's very naturally a strategy of the music industry to make these girls target the admiration of the university and high school demographic. What's more, the number of students remaining virgins even after becoming university students is increasing, and having no actual sexual relationships with female university students of their generation, they're obsessed with idol singers. From the perspective of an older generation, their infantile side should be highlighted.  
  
In other words, in the universities that have been converted into a leisure land after the school wars, focusing on studying for exams, one of the 'plays' for students, who are adults in body but children in mind, are the Sailor Suit Research Club in Kyoudai (Kyoto University) and the Virgin Alliance in Waseda University.  
  
  
**■The Product of Onanism Pet Culture**  
  
Assuming the youth are becoming Lolicon, the origin is the spread of the masturbation is harmless hypothesis resulting in their infantalisation, their moratorium where they refuse to become adults.  
  
In the mid 1970s, the 'Gekisha' (激写) by Shinoyama Kishin (篠山紀信) of 'GORO' became a hit, and 'Weekly Playboy' (週刊ブレイボーイ) and 'Heibon Punch' (平凡パンチ) became more and more popular. As magazines trended towards pin-ups (onanism pets), eventually vinyl books appeared. Features on 'how to persuade women', and magazines that once published practice and theory changed into pin-ups to provide onanism pets.  
  
Excluding some cases, the sexuality of university and high school students isn't being freed. Instead, virginity is increasing massively. Unlike their male peers, the sexuality of female university and high school students are advancing in practice and theory, and despising the virginity of the 'gentle generation', they've started to run towards middle-aged and sexually open partners. Lolicon is the product of the onanism pet culture of the youth who abstain from sexual experience.  
  
This process can be diagrammed as the following.  
  
**Early 60s:** men learn to be professionals, and women cherish virginity.  
  
**Late 60s:** the hypothesis that masturbation is harmless spreads and the slogan becomes 'from masturbation to sex' and for women, 'from love to sex'.  
  
**Early 70s:** for men, from cohabitation to marriage, and for women, premarital sex is the norm and virginity is considered shameful.  
  
**Late 70s:** for men, virgins that only masturbate increase, and only some work hard. For women, middle-age men are considered wonderful, and amateur sex techniques are reproduced in women's magazines.  
  
**Early 80s:** men run towards wank magazines and vinyl books, the Lolicon youth appear. Women are fine with female university students working as vinyl book models or at no-pantie cafes. Sexuality gradually escalates to magazines writing to high teens that '16 years old is a sexually experienced age'.  
  
Onanism pets are, in the end, an object of adoration, an illusion. In fantasy, that which can be depicted with complete freedom of their pose are not real women.  
  
The youth disappointed by real adult women, including those with virgin desire, changed their object to female elementary schoolers and turned into Lolicon.  
  
  
**■The Originator of the 'Alice Boom'**  
  
Before the Lolicon Boom, after the early 70s, there was an Alice Boom.  
  
Lewis Carroll (1832-1898), the author of 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking-Glass' known for their illustrations by Tennyson, was a professor of mathematics under his real name Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. He, like Humbert in 'Lolita', is unable to stifle his feelings and falls in love with the girl who used to model Alice and proposes marriage, but is rejected. Lewis Carroll is also said to have been obsessed with photographing girls and even taking pictures of them nude.  
  
It could be said that this Lewis Carroll was the originator of the current Lolicon youth.  
  
In the 1970s, Kuwabara Shigeo (桑原茂夫) (Age 29), who is the current representative of the editorial production Kamaru-sha (カマル社), edited the 'Supplement Modern Poetry: The World of Lewis Carroll' (別冊現代詩手帖 ルイス・キャロルの世界) (Shichou-sha; 思潮社), which featured photographs of girls by Lewis Carroll, and edited Sawatari Hajime's photobook 'Shoujo Alice' that used the 8 year old girl Samantha as its model. 'Shoujo Alice' includes nude photographs that do not hide the 'slit' of the girl, and is currently referred to as the Lolicon Bible.  
  
A quote from Kuwabara Shigeo.  
  
"It all started when I was editing Lewis Carroll and I saw Carroll's girl photos in the German magazine 'DU' by Tanemura Suehiro (種村季弘), and I thought 'oya'. I was a fan of Shiratori Mizue (白鳥みずえ) in her ballerina costume when she modelled for a Shoujo magazine back in middle school. I wonder if everyone has these sorts of proclivities? Regarding Alice, though there was nothing sexual about it, you could call it sexually stimulating, but the current Lolicon Boom is too direct and hesitant in whether they want to touch little girls. The model, Samantha, recently visited Japan*****, but it wasn't made public. The beautiful girl wants to be left alone as a mysterious girl, and doesn't want to ride the Lolicon Boom."  
**※Note: Samantha Gates, who was an actress, would've been between 14~17 years old when she made this visit to Japan. She played Daisy in the BBC's 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' TV Movie and she and her brother were photographed for a Led Zeppelin album cover.**  
  
Writing the plays called Shoujo such as 'Shoujo Kamen' and 'Shoujo Toshi', Kara Juurou (唐十郎), who developed a particular Shoujo theory by referring to the Shoujo in Tsuge Yoshiharu's (つげ義春) manga as the 'theory of bobbed-cut Shoujo that don't laugh' (笑わぬオカッパの少女論), writes in the afterword of 'Shoujo Kamen', 'boys, before the sea, dream of all sorts of adventures, but girls, opening the disposal lid of the cafe's toilet, peer at the end of their life'.  
  
A quote from Kuwabara, who is the editor of that 'Shoujo Kamen'.  
  
"Everyone was scattered but doing similar stuff. You could say at the time, they all had a Shoujo Complex."  
  
  
**■The Bishoujo Lineup Appearing in Third-rate Gekiga Magazines**  
  
The Alice Boom that centred on Kuwabara Shigeo was not directly followed up by the Lolicon Boom. That's because the Alice Boom image was in 'literature' and the Lolicon Boom image was strongly in 'Manga'. However, in 1979, as 'Shoujo' (Kawade Shobo Shinsha) is edited by Kuwabara as the culmination of 'Shoujo Complex', 'Manga Erogenica' (漫画エロジェニカ) (Kaichosha・1979 June Issue) used the word 'Lolita Complex', introducing it in a form that foresees the following Lolicon Boom.  
  
'Image Adventure 4 Shoujo—Mysterious and Erotic Fairy—' (イメージの冒険４ 少女-謎とエロスの妖精-) (Kawade Shobo Shinsha) was published. This is the 4th instalment in the series, following 'maps', 'picture books', and 'literature'.  
  
In any case, the chronic Lolita Complex is growing, and 'Shoujo' special features illuminate the situation in our Japanese archipelago.  
  
In addition to the favourable essays by geniuses who are Shoujo patients in the current Japanese archipelago, these bizarre books with Shoujo pictures, Shoujo photos, and Shoujo movies were published at the same time as Shinoyama Kishin's '135 Girlfriends' (Shougakukan), and surprisingly when compared to best-sellers, they changed into an epidemic of deep and quiet long-sellers.  
  
This article treats the Lolicon Boom as a disease. It goes without saying 'Lolicon' and 'Sick' are two words showing signs of becoming buzzwords, written half-in-jest.  
  
And this is how Kuwabara Shigeo, the mastermind behind the Alice Boom, and 'Manga Erogenica', which was the first Ero-Gekiga magazines to adopt Lolicon, are connected.  
  
'Manga Erogenica' was the earliest Ero-Gekiga magazines to take the 'Bishoujo Lineup' and narrow the target to Shoujo being the sexual objects. The main authors that drew Shoujo rape were Mangaka such as Nakajima Fumio (中島史雄) Muraso Shunichi (村祖俊一) and Dirty Matsumoto (ダーティ松本), but Taniguchi Kei, who is currently known as a Lolicon Mangaka, made his debut from this magazine.  
  
The characters drawn by Uchiyama Aki, who is said to be Emperor of Lolicon Manga after Azuma Hideo, are more Biyoujo than Bishoujo. Uchiyama, who drew for Ero-Gekiga magazines, is serialising his 'Andoro Trio' in 'Shounen Champion', and is being called a Mangaka who granted civil rights to Lolicon. He draws little girls in diaper play and SM play even in the Shounen magazine 'Shounen Champion' without dropping the voltage, and gained popularity among boys. This is proof the sexual curiosity of boys has grown even stronger since Nagai Go's (永井豪) 'Harenchi Gakuen' (ハレンチ学園).  
  
While the Shoujo Azuma draws are Alice (Shoujo Virgins), the Youjo Uchiyama draws are Lolita (Shoujo Harlots).

![[Pasted image 20250501202632.png]]

**Harenchi Gakuen by Nagai Go. This manga single-handedly turned Shounen Jump into the best-selling Shounen magazine. Nagai gave the elementary and middle schoolgirls the bodies of Playboy models, earning him the ire of the Japanese PTA, who would harass him constantly for being a poor influence on boys. In the comic's finale, Nagai had the PTA show up with the American reserve army, driving tanks into the elementary school, firing mortar shells and machine guns, to murder all of the children.  
  
■The Boys Who Read Shoujo Manga**  
  
What played a major role as a layer of the Lolicon Boom are Manga Doujinshi (Fanzines).  
  
According to Hara Maruta (原丸太), Japan's first Lolicon fanzine was 'Arisu' (愛栗鼠) (First Issue December 1978), which called itself a Lolicon literary magazine, but what triggered the boom was the Lolicon Manga magazine 'Cybele' (シベール), which continued from April 1979 to April 1981.  
  
Since then, Lolicon Doujinshi began being published one after the other, making it so there are 20~30 magazines appearing at Comic Market, a spot sale of Manga Doujinshi. The target of erotica for a number of Lolicon Manga Doujinshi were the Bishoujo Clarisse who appears in the anime 'Lupin the Third', and the Bishoujo Hilda, who appears in the anime 'Future Boy Conan'.  
  
One of the factors that supported the Lolicon Boom were the youth (some of whom were girls) of the Anime generation, and the youth who read Shoujo Manga. The youth that began to enthusiastically read Shoujo Manga were from around when Hagio Moto (萩尾望都), a Mangaka born in 1949 and part of what is known as the Year 24 Flower Group (花の24年組), Ooshima Yumiko (大島弓子), Takemiya Keiko (竹宮恵子), and Yamagishi Ryouko (山岸涼子) started producing excellent works, but for the Lolicon youth, the Bishoujo Marybelle from 'The Poe Clan' (ポーの一族) (Hagio Moto) and the Bishoujo (who is a cat) Suwano Chibi Neko from 'The Star of Cottonland' (綿の国星) (Ooshima Yumiko) were also objects of adoration.  
  
Lolicon Doujinshi mixed in the elements of Anime, Shoujo Manga, Shoujo hobbies (Otome-chic), and Ero Manga to produce the many things that followed.  
  
The majority of the people at the centre of the Lolicon-type fanzines are of university age. Many of these groups are the kinds of dummy groups that make up the university Manga and Anime research clubs.  
  
The current so-called Lolicon fanzine boom is largely due to the power of Azuma Hideo (previously mentioned), an all-mightily popular Mangaka for boys, girls, and adults, and it should be considered his influence spread even further into the general public through 'Cybele'.  
  
And with this boom, the taboo of sexual expression in Manga and fanzines was shattered, and in addition to the influence of those like Uchiyama Aki (Noguchi Masayuki) whose roots stem from erotic Manga (so-called Ero-Gekiga or Third-Rate Gekiga), it is now currently in a sort of an avalanche state.  
  
Hirukogami Ken is an illustrator that draws Youjo rape and Youjo SM in the Doujinshi 'Youjo Fancier' (幼女嗜好) (Published September 1980). He made his appearance in a mysterious style at Comic Market, which sells Doujinshi, wearing a coat, hunting cap, sun glasses, and a mask around his face. At Comic Market, which has the elements of a carnival with youngsters walking around dressed as Manga characters, Hirukogami became a Lolicon-mania star with his perverted criminal looks.  
  
Of course, this is also a game of pretending to be a 'perverted criminal'.  
  
"Well, how do I put this? At first, it was a bad joke, you see. But when I heard 'Nii-san, Nii-san, there's an interesting Doujinshi' from every corner of the venue dressed like this... it turned out to be very nice."  
  
Hirukogami Ken answered such in an interview for the October issue of 'Fusion Product'. He answers the reason he doesn't feel attraction to adult women with 'I guess you could say I have a disgust towards mothers'. He says, 'Shoujo are beings I want to protect and also beings I want to attack', but of course, that's all in illustration; he's nothing more than an imaginary abuser.  
  
Though he's named as the person responsible for supervising the 'Lolicon Complete Works', it was because of his popularity as a character that Kawamoto Kouji edited it.  
  
  
**■Hentai and Executers are the Evil Path?**  
  
There are already fifty kinds of Shoujo photobooks being published. After Sawatari Hajime's 'Shoujo Alice', the most acclaimed works are 'Little Pretenders・Small, Prim and Proper Girls' (リトルプリテンダー・小さなおすまし屋さんたち) (Million Publishing) photographed by Yamamoto Takao (山本隆夫). They say it has sold 70,000 copies of five girls in various poses. Right before the Lolicon Boom.  
  
'Romance' (ロマンス) (Takeshobo), photographed by Aida Garo, is said to have sold over 100,000 copies. As is the case with the photobooks, the buyers of these books aren't limited to the so-called Lolicon youth, but are believed to be mostly normal adults. That is to say, since the parts that need to be smeared with ink on adult women isn't necessary for Shoujo models, they would seek them out in exchange for adult women.  
  
The people that say 'make the poses more explicit' and 'don't cut out the slits!' are likely not Lolicon. Lolicon don't think that way, they instead say such things like 'it doesn't need to be nudes, just show us more cute girls', 'they don't have to wear makeup', or 'frilly clothes are better than nudes'. Being naked isn't an important element for them. ('Bishoujo Photobook Collection Lolicon Don't Obsess Over Nudity' Mutsu Katsuhashi)  
  
Of course, there are extremists in every world. That is the Doujinshi 'Mutation' (突然変異) which aims to 'challenge all taboos'.  
  
This Doujinshi, that became the centre of Keio University students, ran articles such as Omoshiroi-ism Anti-Principle Research, including the obituary of Ishihara Yuujirou (石原裕次郎). As the '6th Year 4th Group Class Newspaper', it also ran Lolicon articles such as 'Pubic Hair from Murata Kyouko-chan's (村田恭子) Bloomers!?'. At some point, 'Hey! Buddy' (ヘイ!バデイー) (Byakuya Shobo) began to be serialised in the '6th Year 4th Group Class Newspaper', and touching upon Article 175 of the Penal Code, in an article written in 'Lolicon Hakusho' (ロリコン白書) (Byakuya Shobo), they called out to middle schoolgirls, and thinking something was weird, mothers were informed and then they were promptly scolded, receiving a warning from the Metropolitan Police Department, deviating from the somewhat kind-hearted Lolicon youth.  
  
As for this 'Mutation', when the mass media picked up the Lolicon Boom, it turned out to be good material for labelling it as 'Hentai' and 'Sick'. Even on TV Asahi's 'Tonight', they have a bitter experience highlighting this point.  
  
Lolicon can be divided into the following:  
①Majority Idealists=Azuma Hideo Bishoujo fans.  
②Hentai=Underground 'Bepi' club members that take nudes of little girls without the parents' permission.  
③Executers=Things that lead to crime like the Roman Polanski Shoujo rape.  
  
Besides these groups, there's the money-making groups who create Lolicon photobooks and Shoujo vinyl books that cannot be sold elsewhere.  
  
Of course, 'Mutation' aren't Executers. However, it's true most of the kind-hearted Lolicon youth are looked upon with disdainful eyes by society due to the Hentai and Executers.  
  
Furthermore, it is believed the most extreme Lolicon as a fantasy is the lurking desire to destroy angels (Holy Being=Shoujo).

![[Pasted image 20250501202710.png]]

**The cover of the first issue of Mutation (突然変異). The mini-magazine was created as an excuse to talk to girls and take pictures by three of the Keio University students (Kurumada, Nishimura, and Ootsuka). They took cameras and a notebook, and went to Kurumada's elementary school, where he used to be beaten by the vice-principal, to conduct an interview with 4 students.  
  
■The Future of Lolicon University Students**  
  
The Lolicon Boom is a mixture of photobooks, illustrations, Manga Doujinshi, Ero Gekiga magazines, and so on.  
  
In 1982, the Lolicon specialty magazine 'Lemon People' (Amatoria-sha), co-authored by Ero Gekigaka and Doujinshi Mangaka, was launched. 'Hey! Buddy', an Erograph magazine with a strong flavour mainly featuring Kondou Masayoshi's (近藤昌良) Shoujo photographs, was given the subtitle 'Beloved Lolicon Magazine' since its May issue. However, 'Lemon People' did not sell many copies, so the number of pages was increased to become a luxury book and was converted into a magazine for maniacs, and 'Hey! Buddy' did not sell well in the Lolicon magazine issue, and has now abandoned the catchphrase 'Beloved Lolicon Magazine'.  
  
It seems things are starting to 'settle down' again. Publishers are groping in the dark for the next boom. However, the Bishoujo fanciers will never vanish. So long as romantic and sentimental youngsters don't vanish.  
  
A quote from Takakuwa Tsunehiro (高桑常寿) (Age 27), editor-in-chief of 'Hey! Buddy'.  
  
"I believe the Lolicon Boom is due to the fact female university students have become strong and high schoolgirls have mostly lost their illusion. The people who come directly to our company to purchase 'Hey! Buddy' are meek individuals like school teachers showing off photos of their students, the kind that thought the elementary schoolers were cute. I heard that the person who drew for the Manga Doujinshi 'Cybele' was also a middle school art teacher."  
  
The majority of the youth responsible for the Lolicon Boom are not like the movie director, Roman Polanski, who actually committed Shoujo rape, and they're not Humbert Humbert who was caught in Shoujo Lolita's coquetry, they're closer to Lewis Carroll, unable to embrace Shoujo Alice, who is said to have remained a virgin all his life, passionate about Shoujo photography.  

> **Harenchi Gakuen by Nagai Go.**

**Speaking of Nagai Go, Dream Dimension Hunter Fandora (夢次元ハンター ファンドラ) was Nagai Go's foray into creating a Hard Lolicon Anime, featuring lesbians and SM, but the original draft was rejected by Kaname Productions; they wanted to do an anime they could sell overseas. So most of the hardcore elements were tuned down with just the preparatory remnants of Nagai's original draft and the merging of his manga style and the Lolicon artstyle remaining.**

![[Pasted image 20250501202801.png]]

> **Mutation (突然変異)**

**This Doujinshi is infamous due to its head editor Ootsuka Masami, who mostly goes by the penname Aoyama Masaaki ([**Wikipedia**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9D%92%E5%B1%B1%E6%AD%A3%E6%98%8E)). Takatori Ei, who wrote this article for The Tsukuru, also contributed an article to Mutation, hence his familiarity with it despite not mentioning Aoyama by name. There's a lot to say about Aoyama in regards to what effect he had on Japan, so I'll quote the following.**  
  
_**"Aoyama Masaaki made his mark in the legendary campus magazine 'Mutation' (突然変異) while a law student at Keio University, and a genius editor who had the most negative impact on Japan in the 80s and 90s, changing the Ero-magazine 'Hey! Buddy' (ヘイ!バディー) for fathers into focusing on Lolicon. He spread drug culture through 'Dangerous Drug' (危ない薬), and towards the end of the century, set trends in bad taste and brutality in 'Dangerous No.1' (危ない1号). A punk-type think tank Tokyo Corporation representative. He committed suicide by hanging on June 17th, 2001. Passing away at 40 years old."**_  
  
**Aoyama was a pioneer of demonic writers that would discuss a wide range of underground scenes from drugs, Lolicon, scatology, and freaks to cult movies, techno, frontier music, heresy, and spiritual worlds. Among Japanese writers who wrote about drugs, he was unique in that he advocated for hedonism. If you fancy yourself someone that would mock people over the internet for being 'unable to separate fiction from reality', Aoyama would put you to the test in trying to separate his fiction from reality. Any serious study of Lolicon in Japan would require researching Aoyama's writings to get an idea of the environment that would come later when Otaku Bashing was in season.**

![[Pasted image 20250501202835.png]]

**The covers for issue 2~4 of Mutation. Despite its appropriately unsettling appearance, Lolicon is a main focus of the mini-magazine. Aoyama wrote an article in the first issue going into detail about his plan to kidnap an orphan. He describes himself going to the children's department of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building to obtain a child welfare facility list that included locations, telephone numbers, capacity, and so on. Then he would later talk to these facilities on the telephone to narrow down which ones would hire a man, and went through the legal hoops to register himself properly as an achievement over losers who have to deal with parents, like the teacher he described that got 6 elementary schoolgirls pregnant and got screwed over cause he picked the Japanese Teacher's Union that dismissed the guy with no retirement allowance. Aoyama says the guy should've joined the Ministry of Education; if you're not a union member, you would get double the retirement allowance during a dismissal.  
  
But regardless, I'll probably translate a couple things Aoyama had to say in regards to the Anime and Manga industry, or the Photobook industry as it relates to overseas (i.e. the United States). I could translate one of his ordinary articles that puts Bob Saget's filthiest joke in history to shame, since unlike Saget, Aoyama's genius IQ puts him in a security mindset where you can imagine the filthy stuff he describes happening in reality.**

I couldn't find a single result for Aoyama Masaaki in English, so that isn't surprising.  
Despite his absolutely foul mouth, the only time he ever got arrested I believe was in the 1990s for cannabis possession.

It has illustrations and stuff of the magazines and other stuff he either dipped his toes in or edited. Aoyama also contributed to the 'Lolicon Complete Works' Hirukogami Ken did; in one article, Aoyama would mention how he got to interview the first Otaku before the word Otaku existed.

**Name Cheat Sheet:**  
Aoyama Masaaki (青山正明)  
Genius Keio University law student.  
  
Shimizu Kazuo (志水一夫) ([**Wikipedia**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BF%97%E6%B0%B4%E4%B8%80%E5%A4%AB_\(%E4%BD%9C%E5%AE%B6\)))  
Shimizu did a Doujinshi review in Fusion Product under the penname Hara Maruta, so he's been a presence that's been mentioned in this thread previously. He's the one that makes this talk Manga or Anime-related, so ctrl+f Shimizu if you're only interested in that.  
  
Saida Sekiya (斉田石也):  
A writer who worked with Kawamoto Kouji.  
  
**This was written in 1994, but goes over the stuff that happened in the previous decades, and also provides some information on the evolution of Lolicon and its spread overseas.**  

**Lolita Period**​
  
**Aoyama Masaaki, Shimizu Kazuo, and Saida Sekiya Three-man Talk "Exams, Women's Rights, and Lolita Culture"**  
  
_Three men involved in Lolita media since its inception speak about what went on behind the scenes of the current boom!? The excessively kitsch Lolita culture born from high mass society!_  
  
**Moderator: Takechi Futoshi (武市太)**  
  
  
──"There is a word called French Lolita, but today I would like to discuss the so-called Japanese Lolita, and I would like to hear what you have to say. The special characteristics of the Japanese Lolita Boom, the background it was born in to become a boom, and the following trends. I would like to capture it in the widest possible perspective, but first, could you tell us about the time Lolita was born in Japan?"  
  
Saida: "1966, the photobook called '12 Year Old Mythology' was first, you see."  
  
──"Can we consider that as the beginning of its commercial, its visual development? In the literary world, Shibusawa Tatsuhiko (澁澤龍彦), for example, talked about Lolita in a much earlier stage."  
  
Saida: "If you're going that far, then things start to get messy. For example, depending on how you read it, Kawabata Yasunari's (川端康成) 'The Izu Dancer' (伊豆の踊子) and 'Snow Country' (雪国) would also be included in this category."  
  
Aoyama: "By the riverside, there's stuff like 'Sleeping Beauty' (眠れる美女)."  
  
Shimizu: "If I remember correctly, 'The Izu Dancer' was 14 years old. The same age as 'Sailor Moon' (laughs)."  
  
Saida: "So you're suddenly connecting 'The Izu Dancer' to 'Sailor Moon' (laughs)?"  
  
Aoyama: "Why not? What he said makes sense (laughs). Strictly speaking, it has been around for quite some time in the world of painting and literature. For example, 'Pepi's Experience' (ペピの体験) published by Fujimi Roman Bunko. Back in 1971, it was serialised several times in an underground erotic magazine called 'Erochika' and the original work was around long before it entered Fujimi Roman Bunko. Well, even if it had the foundation for one to enjoy such paintings and literary works as a personal hobby, it wasn't established as a single world. The thing that came out as a portent of the genre was '12 Year Old Mythology'."  
  
Saida: "That's right. But that wasn't made with Lolicon in mind."  
  
Shimizu: "Back then, it was more or less pure photography."  
  
Aoyama: "It was art (laughs). So, continuing from there, the ban on pornography was lifted in the Netherlands, Denmark, and other countries around the early 70s, and stuff like child porn started coming out. Like 'Moped*****' swept through Japan with a 'dah'..."  
**※Moped came from the United States; the material was from a nudist colony.**  
  
Saida: "You mean stuff like 'Nymph Lover', right? From around 77 to 78, men embracing girls began to enter Japan."  
  
Shimizu: "I believe 'Little Pretenders' was a big deal. Everyone was looking for it cause the slits were properly photographed (laughs). And then it was immediately reprinted (laughs). It was all just a substitute for the real thing. Cause the ban on showing pubic hair hadn't been lifted then like it is now."  
  
Aoyama: "Hair was bad, but slits were perfectly fine. That was their reasoning, wasn't it?"  
  
Saida: "That was how it was back then. Nosaka Akiyuki's (野坂昭如) trial, Takahashi Keiko's (関根恵子) nudes, whatever, hair was hair. If it didn't have hair, it didn't count as a sex organ. So a child's genitals still didn't count as a sex organ, it was just an excretory organ."  
  
Shimizu: "Also, so long as you're young, it didn't matter if you had an adult body. But that would be different from Lolicon in the truest sense."  
  
Saida: "The one that catered to all those needs was 'Shoujo M' (少女M) with its completely grown-up bodies."  
  
Aoyama: "When I saw 'Shoujo M', it reconfirmed my latent desires, giving me a sense of relief that made me go 'ahh, thank god', it became my excuse..."  
  
Saida: "Hm, so it wasn't just me."  
  
Shimizu: "Everyone were going 'thank god~♥' (laughs)."  
  
Aoyama: "Since then, more and more books came out and there must've been quite a few people who were newly awakened to Lolicon. Whether it be a desire of turning Shoujo into a sexual object or a seedling of a mentality, it feels like those instincts began to expand rapidly."  
  
Saida: "At the time, there were university students that treated being a Lolicon as if it were a fashion, like they were on the cutting edge of fashion."  
  
Shimizu: "There was a story about the Lolicon-type stuff disappearing from the neighbourhood vinyl bookstores whenever there was an SF convention in Asakusa (laughs). They say those guys that went to the SF convention would buy them on their way home*****. They'll do anything that's fashionable."  
**※This incident was covered in the 1981 issue 17 of Animec.**  
  
Aoyama: "I heard about that as well. They must've been excited during SF conventions, having everything sold out."

![[Pasted image 20250501203054.png]]

**The 1981 Issue 17 of Animec cover; the article in question has been transcribed here ([**Link**](https://web.archive.org/web/20061120114642/http://hugo-sb.way-nifty.com/hugo_sb/2006/08/post_19aa.html)). Maybe I'll translate it, since it's kind of funny.  
  
■Lolicon as an Atavism**  
  
──"Even if Lolita nudes came out as a substitute, when you consider the difference in the West, for example, there is a Christian ethic against sexuality in the West, and they're much stricter in the way they treated their kids. So why is Japan turning to Lolita rather than fully mature women...? Is Japan special?"  
  
Shimizu: "Perhaps it has something to do with the fact Buddhism forbids sexual relations between normal men and women. Hentai has been considered fine for a long time in Japan, people didn't mind Kabuki or Takarazuka, but normal relationships between men and women were regulated. On the presumption women couldn't be brought to the battlefield, homosexuality traditionally existed, and girls' love was also a tradition since the period of 'The Tale of Genji'. Homosexuality wasn't taboo in Japan until the Taisho Period. The Taisho democracy suddenly made it bad. I never got the reason why, though."  
  
Aoyama: "I read a book called 'Sexual Word Records' (性の世界記録), and during the Edo period, in Yoshiwara, there were things that couldn't be described as anything other than babies that were raised exclusively for fellatio. In those days, people got married by the age of 12 or 13. It would be like if 6th graders or middle schoolers got married, but that's pointing out the obvious."  
  
──"When you consider the special soil in Japan, I was shocked when the Lolita photobooks came from overseas, I thought I went back to my ancestry."  
  
Aoyama: "Right. What we took as a given had been repressed for a lo~ong time, then thanks to that coming, images of guys doing strange and Hentai stuff started floating to the surface."  
  
──"The Lolita at the time would've been like a hundred flowers blooming in profusion, right?"  
  
Aoyama: "That would be from the early 80s to the mid-80s when 'Hey! Buddy' was being published. Around the 80s, the town magazine 'Pia' gained popularity, and people decided that boys and girls should play together, so more playgrounds were built, and they played together, but the reality was awful. The illusion was broken, and a whole army corps came stampeding for the girls."  
  
Saida: "Back then, with the tone of 'Hey! Buddy', it must've felt like collecting photobooks and reading books wasn't enough. So people went out into the city to take pictures. Like whenever they had a chance, they would slip into the shadows (laugh). There's a page called 'Shoujo Bullying Photos' and it felt like you were there in the room, stripping her..."  
  
Shimizu: "You're talking about 'mostly criminal photos', right?"  
  
Saida: "It's nothing other than a crime (laugh). However, it was a period where the readers could immediately become the creators. The current contribution magazines weren't like that. From around 'Hey! Buddy', the number of pages for reader submissions increased dramatically, like one day, some guy shows up with a cardboard box saying 'I took this many Shoujo photos' and later that guy became a Sensei. I, myself, contributed to 'CANDY'."  
  
Aoyama: "I also wrote about how to get European child pornography in my university's mini-magazine, and then I was called by the editor-in-chief of 'Hey! Buddy' (Takakuwa Tsunehiro) (laugh). Even when I started creating Lolita books, the people I worked with were not professional writers or artists. There were only people like Saida-san, who was a salaryman, at the time."  
  
Shimizu: "The same thing happened when Anime boomed. When it comes to the people who know Anime, it was nothing but fans. And they had a problem where they had a small budget, so there were mook editors who had amateurs make them in the back. There were even cases of independent filmmakers suddenly making a movie and turning professional."  
  
Saida: "If you look at it from the perspective of Lolicon magazines, you would see the Manga 'Lemon People' and the photo mag 'Hey! Buddy' side by side. After that, you would see stuff like 'Manga Burikko' and Taiyoh Tosho's 'Alice Club'."  
  
Shimizu: "'Manga Burikko' wasn't always like that, and then it suddenly switched to Lolita. It was doing special features on Lolicon Mangaka one after the other."  
  
Aoyama: "It was the same for 'Hey! Buddy'. It used to be an ordinary ero-book, and then it turned into Lolita."  
  
Shimizu: "Wasn't 'Shoujo Alice' a big deal in the late 70s? The vending machine book. In there, Azuma Hideo-san drew Lolita Manga. It was big. The vending machine books back then had all sorts drawing for them, it was interesting."  
  
Aoyama: "Vending machine books weren't just about Lolita, they were also about scatology, drugs, and the occult, a lawless zone. They were truly the most interesting media."

![[Pasted image 20250501203124.png]]

**Manga Burikko (漫画ブリッコ)began in 1982, but its poor sales caused its original editor-in-chief to pass the baton to Ootsuka Eiji six months later in 1983, who turned the magazine into the 2nd Lolicon Manga magazine after Lemon People. Under Eiji, half the readership demographic were reported to be teenage girls.  
  
■Lolicon's Connection to Manga Doujinshi**  
  
Aoyama: "The guys doing Manga Doujinshi started to draw more and more in the Lolicon-style, but how did that unfold?"  
  
Saida: "At first, they were parodies. Stuff like 'Heidi, Girl of the Alps', 'Candy Candy', and 'Urusei Yatsura'.  
  
Shimizu: "Shortly before those, it was the first time a heroine with a bust appeared in an Anime. Tsuji Masaki-san (辻真先), who's currently active as a detective writer, wrote the main scenario for 'Mahou no Mako-chan' (魔法のマコちゃん). Before then, none of the girls had breasts (laugh). After that, the same staff made 'Cutie Honey' (キューティハニー), and then 'Majokko Megu-chan' (魔女っ子メグちゃん). With the same main staff."  
  
Shimizu: "So after a while, the people who came and went to Azuma Hideo-san's place got to know each other at Manga Gallery (**まんが画廊; a Manga Caf_é_**) and invited Azuma-san as a guest to create the Doujinshi called 'Cybele'. Azuma-san was a pioneer of the work drawn in Seinen magazines with a Shounen magazine artstyle, but with a clearly sexual bent."  
  
Shimizu: "However, when it boomed, it was suddenly discontinued. Everyone became frustrated and started publishing their own Doujinshi one after another. It was a time you could sell anything, it would disappear in all the excitement. Even the stuff with my art sold (laugh)."  
  
Shimizu: "Also, the existence of 'Gundam' was big, 'Gundam' was awesome. The bodies of the female characters were all carefully drawn and you could tell who they were even if they hid their faces or wore the same clothes. So doing nudes of 'Gundam' in Doujinshi became common."  
  
Shimizu: "Copies were secretly being made as it was going around until then, but the one that properly did it first in Doujinshi was the female character nudes special edition of 'Gundam', a Doujinshi by 'Nonki' (のんき), who's currently working as a professional. Also, there was 'Venus' that was the Anime-version of Vinyl books acting like its sister magazine. These two had been recalled by the print shop."  
  
Shimizu: "After that, now it's 'Comic Box', but back then, there was an article asking 'What is Lolicon Doujinshi?' in the Bishoujo special feature in 'Fusion Product'. I wrote it in 1981 (laugh), there I introduced the contents of 'Cybele', but for the others, I only had the cover pages. Everyone had the illusion that since 'Cybele' was the only one shown, while the others were not, that 'Cybele' was the best (laugh). So when people went to the next Comiket, they had it in their checklist and bought it (laugh). Back then, nude scenes were all the rage in Anime. There was also the influence of Lum-chan; there were enough nude scenes in that Anime to be videotaped and released as a Doujinshi (laugh)."  
  
Shimizu: "However, the very first nude scene in Anime, apart from 'Honey', was Mori Yuki's warp scene in 'Yamato'. Also when the word Lolicon was used in Miyazaki Hayao-san's 'Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro', it must've been triggered by the Bishoujo special feature in 'Animec' as a way of accepting it. The person in charge of the special feature is the current editor-in-chief of 'Newtype' (ニュータイプ). The people associated with Lolicon back then are getting ahead in life (laugh)."  
**I'm imagining everyone spaced out as Shimizu went on this rant. But all roads lead back to Fusion Product. Also, he's referencing the same issue of Animec as the one above.  
  
■Lolita as the Ideal Female Image**  
  
Aoyama: "The Anime and Manga types were also the same as the photo magazines and Executers. They all had their roots, but the same trigger. With a 'well then, me too, me too'. The number of people turning into artists and the number of fans were steadily growing. In parallel with such a boom, the relative status of men has steadily declined. It's a matter of fact the stronger a woman becomes, the more she loses her innocent side."  
  
Shimizu: "Right around the Lolicon Boom, wasn't there an Onee-san Boom? In short, for the Lolicon, there's girls they can deceive, and for the Onee-sama, there's women who'll deceive them. There's a theory they all share the same root."  
  
Saida: "The term Peter Pan Syndrome became popular."  
  
Aoyama: "Also, I believe the exam system and the development of the sex industry are linked. For example, men in the past would go to the red-light district when they're around 16, but now there's an unspoken understanding to put that off until you enter university. So, they're being repressed."  
  
Aoyama: "It's only natural for delusions to expand when you repress them, and taking advantage of that, erotic media was developed and porn mags were sold, leading to a rapid abundance of masturbation. Then with the videos and magazines, their delusions rapidly expanded and when they're finally the age they can do the real thing, they end up masturbating instead. Whether they like it or not, their delusions towards women steadily expanded until, at last, they enter university and the ban is lifted."  
  
Aoyama: "However, the reality is that dating is annoying; you have to buy them all sorts of things, you have to keep taking them somewhere, and the sex is heavy and stinks (laugh). It never meets the pink nipple they were imagining. There's a huge gap in that area."  
  
Shimizu: "Women demand a fifty-fifty relationship, but it's a fact men are in the end saying they don't want to do that."  
  
Aoyama: "Around the time 'Hey! Buddy' collapsed, Takasugi Dan-san (高杉弾) said this during the 'Playboy' roundtable talk, but in short, he said until he reached the third year of high school, he masturbated with his penis upright, full of energy and vigour, but when he entered university and had sex with women, he said that no matter how many times he tried, he couldn't muster the interest to get it up. That kind of thing is very common."  
  
Shimizu: "That's a very symbolic story."  
  
Aoyama: "They no longer desire university students, and either lower the target age, or raise it up to Onee-sans or mothers. Sending them off to a rich masturbation life in a sea of delusion. I feel this area's the base of the boom. They thought nether regions were pretty and beautiful, but the reality is they look like leftover Sukiyaki meat. 'Huh, what's this?' (laugh). And so they run off into their pseudo-worlds. Starting with something from Manga or photos. What they're seeking there are the ideal and innocent Lolita-type female. Ones with firm and supple skin, and pretty, pinkish nipples."  
  
Shimizu: "Even among the Mangaka-sans who appeared from the so-called Lolicon Doujinshi, there's plenty who draw them for their own use (laugh)."  
  
Saida: "As for that, even in the world of novels, it was the same for me (laugh). Writers such as ○○ and ×× are still doing it now. They wank when they write, they wank when it's being edited by the proofreader, and then they wank again as they read the end result (laugh)."  
  
**■Adult Albeit Lolita**  
  
──"In the Lolita world, I get the impression sub-divisions are always forming. For example, Lolita with big breasts; I doubt such things exist in reality, but there isn't any problem there, is there?"  
  
Aoyama: "In the world of Manga and Anime, when you draw a pure, adult woman, she's a fake; she's been set in such a way anyone can tell it's a lie. In order to have a certain degree of realism, you have no choice but to lower her age."  
  
Saida: "From my perspective of writing novels, the situation has already regressed. If you write with the vision of elementary and middle schoolers who live on the cutting edge of reality, you will fail. To have a pure middle schooler, who is mostly ignorant about sex, you would need to prepare something realistic, like a cram school teacher or cram school. However, that's just doing the same thing as the kids from the old days."  
  
Shimizu: "In Manga, there would be things like aliens or androids. Then there's the kind of patterns where a cute cat changes into a girl. Like a pet."  
  
Aoyama: "Make it old-fashioned, bring home a cat, she came from outer space, or she's a goddess (laugh). That's the only way to think about it. With an innocent face and a plump, adult body, she's the boxed garden work being demanded."  
  
Saida: "In that sense, the worlds of Anime and comics are better able to bring such things into being."  
  
Shimizu: "There's talk of Agnes Lum being a harbinger, or a prelude, of that. A baby-face with a well-developed body. It's directly connected to Lum-chan from 'Urusei Yatsura' (うる星やつら).

![[Pasted image 20250501203200.png]]

**The 1990s dabbled in describing ロリ (Loli) characters with 巨乳 (Big Breasts). The earliest instance of the compound ロリ巨乳 (Oppai Loli) I found was in 2001 as the tentative title of the manga '禁断のロリ巨乳（仮）' (Kindan no Rori Kyonyuu) by '据虎涼' (Suetora Ryou). A manga by that title wasn't released, but another manga by the same artist was released in 2002 called 'マジ・ブラ・バーニング' (Maji Bura Burning), and it has '乳萌え作品' (Boob Moe Work) written on the cover.  
  
■Collection Libido**  
  
Saida: "I don't know much about porn media, but when it comes to the so-called readers of the current ero books, you have the Lolicon on one side and on the other, you used to have those obsessed with female university students, but now not so much; they couldn't empathise with them and when they went to high schoolers, they were exposed to bloomers and sailor suits, it's no joke to say they're finally flowing to middle schoolers."  
  
Saida: "So the reason things swelled up now is due to the guys flowing in from the bloomers and sailor suits. To put it bluntly, isn't what's stirring the current industry 'timid perverts' rather than Lolicon? I believe the former are much more common. The Asashi Shimbun reporter incident and the Yoshimoto Kogyo comedian incident were widely reported, things got scary for men to stick their hands out, so in the end, they had no choice but to escape into the world of media."  
  
Aoyama: "A world where the specialty magazine 'Alice Club' publishes 80,000 issues."  
  
Saida: "So the most distinctive change is the cataloguing of intentions. Looking at the reader contributions, it's such that they shout 'ya—y, I got it' when they obtain a 30,000 yen book at premium market price at the bookstores for 20,000 yen. Then there's the one who bought the photobook taken by the late Kiyooka Sumiko (清岡純子) 'Petit Fairy' for 450,000 yen. Just collecting. Such individual maniacs that cannot get an erection unless it's a Shoujo or feel nothing but loathing and disgust if there's hair may be hiding in a dark and narrow world, but I don't get that feeling so much from the readers of 'Alice Club'. Also, what feels like media is coming in contributions to my place as 'well, well, such a momentary thing'. Whenever it turns hot on the news any day or month, there's some incident where children are playing in the river in only their underwear or something at school, where there's girls in bloomers wandering around the corner of the screen."  
  
Shimizu: "They must be running their videos 24-7."  
  
Saida: "They must be. They're always looking for stuff like that. What in the hell are they looking for? I wonder if they would be satisfied with being hired."  
  
Aoyama: "Libido bends more towards their collection than ejaculation. For them, that's somehow better than an orgasm. Well, there's also computers and various sorts of things, but..."  
  
  
**■Japanese Lolita takes the World by Storm!**  
  
Aoyama: "In the future, I believe Japanese Lolita will expand overseas. Meaning if you give the Japanese sex industry money, they'll provide the same service. I did some data collecting in Hawaii before, but from what I hear, America is different. Negotiations begin after purchase, and if they don't want to do something with you, they say no and keep all the money. In the end, it seems they've been brought into a normal relationship between men and women. Since their customs require that men be submissive, I asked if there were anything like Otaku there, and there were (laugh). There's enough groundwork to flow right in and set up shop."  
  
Saida: "In fact, during the boom, I heard an overseas business department came to buy books in bulk from certain Lolicon shops in Tokyo. Books without a bookstore code such as 'Candy' or 'Alice'.  
  
──"Sounds like America is accepting some of it, eh?"  
  
Aoyama: "I heard that 'Urusei Yatsura' and 'Aah, Megami-sama' (ああっ女神さまっ) are already out there."  
**The greatest irony is the number of Americans unaware these titles are Lolicon-related.**  
  
Shimizu: "The title there is 'Oh, My, Goddess' (laugh)."  
  
Saida: "The same is true for porn media; the reason 'Petit Tomato' went crazy was cause American porno shops were importing more and more Japanese stuff, which later was considered a problem. I couldn't help but laugh when I heard it, but it seems there's no problem so long as it was a Japanese Shoujo. But when a book with three white girls drifted in along with the rest, they said 'this is outrageous' and were caught. So, people wondered what the hell Japan was doing, and it seems 'Petit Tomato' were quickly caught."  
  
Aoyama: "Even when I was doing Lolita stuff, I received many letters from Holland. They wrote that they'll pay big if they're sent Japanese Lolita photos."  
  
Saida: "Something like that's practically unheard of in America, so whether it's embracing or just standing there naked, that stuff is very valuable for them."  
  
  
**■Being a Man is Hard**  
  
Aoyama: "The reproduction of illusions will be continuing into the future, after all, I wonder if men will desire Shoujo in the real world. Or if it's legally impossible, I wonder if international marriages will become popular. Most of them may not be Lolita, but there's men marrying innocent-looking Asian females. This isn't directly related to the Lolita phenomenon, but I believe it's a similar trend. Purity feels like it only exists in the media world or the third world. I mean, in a man's mind."  
  
Saida: "Even in the visual world, a practical problem is that if you create purity guys don't want, it won't be accepted by the readers."  
  
Shimizu: "Even in SM novels, they use the word choice in 'Tokyo Story' (東京物語) (laugh). Over the mountains, far to travel, people say, purity dwells."  
  
Saida: "When it comes to that, I wonder if Lolita media will keep going as it is now. In a place like an unfulfilled dream."  
  
Shimizu: "Perhaps, but then Lolicon Manga will get boring (laugh). People with no experience pretty much just imitate other people's Manga. Everyone's the same."  
  
Aoyama: "Getting bored with the state of media is a huge problem! Not only Lolita, but even scatology and pregnancy stuff, makes you want to take a burp from the media consumption."  
  
Saida: "Desire itself is already expanding further and further, so..."  
  
Aoyama: "If it keeps going, even looking at an average women will make you say 'someone like you is just no good'. What I'm trying to find is if there's anything other than a woman that can make a dick stand erect. There isn't much, though (laugh). Well, the conflict between men and women, even if you separate it from Lolita, will keep expanding endlessly. Women have an overwhelming sense of reality, like going somewhere or having sex. At first glance, they seemed to have evolved, but they're doing it with old dudes."  
  
──"Put a switch on a woman and a man would be a fool to go out to play (laugh)."  
  
Shimizu: "That's a way to put it."  
  
Aoyama: "It's strange for a woman to desire a third year high school guy. Since that kind of guy is someone pushing through the centre of the exam system, he must be immersed in a pseudo-world to some extent. Rather they are choosing construction workers or vocational school students. Despite being a construction worker, his face is that of Kusakari Masao (草刈正雄) (laugh)."  
  
Saida: "Such a guy doesn't exist (laugh)."  
  
Aoyama: "I believe OL of first-class companies with a strong libido will be combining construction workers and vocational school students. On second thought. It's not Adam and Eve, but genitals are better if they're hidden; there's a story in America where everyone who joins a nudist colony becomes impotent. Cause they're looking at cocks and pussies all year round. I've also seen thousands of pussies, including photos. I'm already tired of such things. When I think about it that way, sexual liberation may not have been a good thing. People can easily buy porn videos and porn books, and if you pay money, you can get a cute girl in through customs. If you keep doing that sort of stuff, your... thoughts will sink lower."  
  
──"Well, women may have it good, but it's really hard 'being a man' (laugh)."  

**There's a bunch of extra articles giving context to some of the stuff mentioned in the talk, but practically none of it is Anime or Manga related. Just stuff 'Hey! Buddy' and about whether the photobooks will experience a revival through overseas Otaku, the extreme child pornography that came from the United States and Europe, how overseas there are paedophile organisations trying to lower the age of consent and similar political groups not existing in Japan despite there being so many Lolicon, concluding the lack of those groups is due to most Japanese Lolicon being content with simple media consumption through comics, video, and gravure. Aoyama wrote a couple, but it's just him mentioning how there's all sorts of Lolicon and what truly piques his curiosity are the bona fide, clinically-diagnosed paedophiles and crap about tricking girls to ingest semen through yogurt and water fountains.**

**Otaku Subculture Free Talk  
"Broaching the Greatest Otaku Taboo: What is Otaku Sex?"**​
  
**Takekuma Kentarou (竹熊健太郎) ([**Wikipedia**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AB%B9%E7%86%8A%E5%81%A5%E5%A4%AA%E9%83%8E)):**  
**Writer and manga author; wrote the instructional book 'Even a Monkey Can Draw Manga'.**  
  
**Okada Toshio (岡田斗司夫) (**[**Wikipedia**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B2%A1%E7%94%B0%E6%96%97%E5%8F%B8%E5%A4%AB)**) (**[**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/user/toshiookada0701)**):  
The founder of Gainax; self-proclaimed Otaking with his own Youtube channel discussing everything Otaku-related.**  
  
Unpopular, Lolicon, 2D-Complex... When it comes to heterosexual relationships, Otaku don't have a particularly good image. What do they want in sex? The long unspoken Otaku mystery is now revealed.  
  
**Moderator: Ui You (宇井洋)  
  
■Why are Otaku Lolicon?**  
  
―—Though the theme for this occasion is Otaku and sex, let's begin by discussing the ecchi books for Otaku Okada brought for us.  
  
Okada: "Ero books can be roughly divided between photos, Manga, and novels, but what's seen a recent growth are Lolicon novels for Otaku. For example, France Shoin (フランス書院), who are famous for their ero-novels, publish them, but I've leafed through a quarter of the ero-novels for Otaku published in Japan."  
  
Takekuma: "Do you like them? (laughs)."  
  
Okada: "I like sex through media."  
  
Takekuma: "As for ero-books for Otaku, the longest established one is 'Lemon People'."  
  
Okada: "Though it's long established, its popularity is waning. What's alive and well is 'E-LOGIN'. It's an Eroge book being published by ASCII (アスキー), but through another company called Aspect (アスペクト). Cause Eroge are the computer games most people are playing. What's supporting Japan's PC98 are nothing but Eroge."  
  
Takekuma: "Okada-san, himself, was originally a guy making bank through Eroge."  
  
Okada: "Yes. But Takekuma-san was also writing for the Lolicon magazine called 'Manga Burikko' back in the 80s."  
  
Takekuma: "That's because I couldn't find work anywhere else but there at the time. Everyone was like that back then. It was a place they could take up the pen. That's why I, myself, didn't have very many of what you would call Lolicon hobbies. However, everyone around me had those hobbies, so I got to see the process of the Lolicon Boom from up close."  
  
Okada: "Back then, Lolicon was an idea. Actually, girls didn't mind and the idea known as Lolicon was treated as cool. I wouldn't say it was morally corrupt, but it was twisted. Back then, the Lolicon photobooks didn't sell very well."  
  
Takekuma: "I was in my first or second year of high school when Sawatari Hajime's photobook 'Shoujo Alice' came out. Well, though it was a girl, surprisingly her slit was photographed. I also bought it. Lolicon maniacs from our generation were mostly shocked by 'Shoujo Alice'. Well, if I went towards Lolicon from there, I didn't tread very far. It's just the people around me who started along that path. The First Impact is the photobook 'Shoujo Alice'. I believe there's no doubt about this. Before that, Lolicon only existed among the dilettantes. The real underground. But that book was how it immediately spread above ground."  
  
Okada: "Afterwards, there was a middle-aged female photographer called Kiyooka Sumiko (清岡虹子) (Mama). She had a photo collection called 'Petit Tomato' that spanned 12 volumes, and Karasawa-san (唐沢) saw them at the used bookstore for 17,000 yen. I was thinking 'uwaah', but they really were 17,000 yen per volume."  
  
Takekuma: "That's already a legend among the dilettantes. I just thought of them as dirty photos."  
  
Okada: "Ever since she passed away, their used value went up."  
  
Takekuma: "In any case, in the late 70s, before the Anime Boom, 'Shoujo Alice' came out. So the Anime Boom happened. And with that, the cel-art maniacs came out of hiding. That was probably around 77~78. So, around 79, the Ero-magazine called 'Gekiga Alice' from Alice Publishing was released. In there, Azuma Hideo started doing something like a deep and surreal erotic gag Manga. They were incredibly popular among the Otaku. Him doing something so outrageous with the cute, Tezuka Osamu-style was quite the shock. In Japan's Lolicon history, this would be the Second Impact. Around that time, Lolicon Doujinshi began appearing at Comiket. Linking them to the beginning of Anime parodies. First, there was the Anime Boom, then the desire to violate pure Anime, like Heidi or Anne of Green Gables (赤毛のアン), naturally welled up. Among maniacs, the medium where you could honestly draw that were Doujinshi. I believe it was around the 80s when that trend began to manifest itself."  
  
Okada: "Speaking of crossing the final line, it was the Hiromori Shinobu's (currenly Nonki) Lana violation Manga. By then, Miyazaki Hayao lost complete control over the guys drawing any kind of Anime fan ero-parodies."  
  
Takekuma: "Those who violate that which is holy."  
  
Okada: "Speaking of which, Hiromori Shinobu did that sort of stuff to both Lana-chan and Clarisse (both Miyazaki Anime heroines). The guys who saw them thought he was a fiend, so that's how he got his break. Since then, everyone could get away with anything."  
  
Takekuma: "It was around 82~83 when Hiromori Shinobu broke through like that. Well, at the time, he was an inept Mangaka."  
  
Okada: "Otaku called it Lolicon, but it was a style. They play at being Lolicon outside, but once they return home, they're mostly mild-mannered. Similar to how the people who used to be involved in student movements were forced to read Marx and Engels when they gathered in their clubs, they play at being a Lolicon while outside and read Shounen magazines when they're back at home. That's where they diverge from normal people. Outside, most of them had not just photobooks of girls, but Lolicon books in their club rooms, but when they return home, they find that stuff boring. So when the Miyazaki Tsutomu (宮崎勤) incident happened, what surprised those around me was that there was someone in this world who actually liked little girls. I thought it was just a style, but there was someone who was serious about it."  
  
Takekuma: "Well, regardless if it's a dilettante's hobby, reality is reality, hobbies were mostly hobbies, it's just like Okada-san says. At first, it might've purely been wank-off material. They figured out it was fine to photograph a little girl's nether regions. It was fine before she grows hair down there."  
  
Okada: "When I was doing an Anime company in Osaka, I read Lolicon Manga with the staff and there was a commotion. Only one among them was the real deal. He was around 30 years old, and he said 'I also took photos of stuff like that'. When he said that, everyone pulled away (laugh). They pulled away all at once saying, 'wah, the real deal's here'. It was as if a real soldier came to a place where everybody was pretending to have a war. At that moment, we realised we ourselves weren't Lolicon, but fashion."  
  
Takekuma: "Well, when the fashion guys grow in number, some among them will misunderstand and the real deal will also show up. Besides, I believe there is some percentage of the population who are genuine, regardless of fashion."

**I find it interesting they used ロリコン顔 (Lolicon Face). I wonder if that's an error for ロリ顔 (Loli-face) by the moderator, or if that is an actual term used back in the 1990s. France Shoin is also responsible for their Bishoujo Bunko (美少女文庫) brand, it's been around so long, I even imported erotic light novels from it. Though one of the writers, Wakatsuki Hikaru, said on her blog those kinds of books are called Juvenile Porno (ジュブナイルポルノ), which is the most awkward choice of words to describe erotic novels that use Anime and Manga style for their covers and illustrations (**[**Wikipedia**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A5%E3%83%96%E3%83%8A%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB%E3%83%9D%E3%83%AB%E3%83%8E)**).  
  
■Otaku Cannot Get Drunk on Themselves**  
  
Takekuma: "When it comes to understanding relationships between the opposite sex, I believe there is a big turning point in adolescence where you decide between going to Manga and Anime, or going to music. The point that decides whether you're an Otaku or a fashion bastard."  
  
Okada: "It's my opinion, but it's the difference in whether you want to be the 'manly guy' or the 'big dummy that cares only about looks'."  
  
Takekuma: "When you join a band with a guitar, isn't there generally a style you need to fit in with the guitar? If it were nowadays, they would be DJs rather than guitarists. People need to make sure their fashion is appropriate for the occasion."  
  
Okada: "Also, Otaku don't drink. I believe we have something in common in that regard, but Otaku aren't good at getting drunk. On both alcohol and on themselves."  
  
Takekuma: "Ah, there's quite a few. I've also been drinking a beer or two recently, but I don't drink till I'm drunk."  
  
Okada: "Basically, people who go into fashion or music are drunkards, drunk on themselves. Themselves and their opinions."  
  
Takekuma: "Yeah, you might be onto an important point."  
  
Okada: "I've been thinking about this for a long time, but Otaku don't get drunk. So, they're basically sober. There's something cool about that. Otaku go in the direction of increasing their ability to understand the world or heighten their cognitive skills to become humble old geezers."  
  
Takekuma: "They might be getting drunk on humbleness (laugh). Meaning, they're embarrassed to be seen by people in an absent-minded state. That's why I also don't like people seeing my sleeping face."  
  
Okada: "Also, they don't understand pleasure."  
  
Takekuma: "They believe they make a stupid face when they have sex, and that alone makes them feel cold. Sex is not a world where you can immerse yourself. Perhaps there's a part that finds it embarrassing to being seen with such a stupid face. In Otaku psychology."  
  
Okada: "In my opinion, the most severe Otaku can't even masturbate."  
  
Takekuma: "Yeah, those exist, don't they?"  
  
Okada: "I believe they probably do. Cause no matter what anyone says, stimulation alone is not enough. They need to imagine something. I wonder if the guys who can't do it are the exception. However, despite saying such, I believe that's a way of thinking the intoxication-types don't understand. Even in relationships with girls, when faced with the reasoning of normal people who say 'but you'll be unpopular with the ladies', Otaku would respond, 'then why do you need a girl?'. Is what they're doing sex with a woman, masturbation with a woman, or masturbation with a right hand? Whether it's masturbation with only a right hand partner, or basically an illusion in their head. Since it's an illusion, it's a woman they can fall in love with. This is my personal theory, but looking at it plainly, there's no creature as ugly as a woman."  
  
Takekuma: "So, it's fools watching dancing fools, but Otaku are the fools watching. So while mocking the dancing fools, they enjoy watching the foolish dance of the dancing fools. But from the point of view of the dancing fools who know the joy of forgetting themselves, Otaku are lonely people. Building a wall around themselves. I also cannot even go to a disco. After all, I was with my friends and they were like 'let's go to a disco', so I went, but I didn't know how to behave."  
  
Okada: "Unable to get drunk. Karaoke is the only way Otaku have found to get drunk in the last few years."  
  
Takekuma: "Karaoke with normal customers was no good. Cause they don't want to see themselves getting drunk. So the creation of the Karaoke Box may have been a great idea."  
  
Okada: "But I cannot do Karaoke. I cannot associate myself with things that don't interest me. That's why I don't go."  
  
Takekuma: "But that's a point I understand. I may not be as cool as Okada-san, but I'm also the same."  
  
Okada: "Otaku don't really go to prostitutes, either."  
  
Takekuma: "They don't go."  
  
Okada: "They don't go to prostitutes, they don't hang out with girls, that's why so many of them are virgins. So that just leaves them with masturbation. It's one of the greatest taboos that has yet to be put into complete words."  
  
Takekuma: "After all, they themselves are riding the cutting board. To be honest, though we're all Otaku, we don't really know what other people are like. Can you really generalise them?"  
  
Okada: "In a typical all-male circle, the topic of sex is excluded because the deviation value is low, so they don't understand other people's sex lives."  
  
Takekuma: "Although some may concede and bring up the topic of masturbation."  
  
Okada: "That's because an Otaku's money goes into their hobbies, they don't go out with girls."

It's a long lecture, so the article is also long with multiple sections. One of the sections goes over the possible adverse effects Lolita Anime has over girls through media like 'Pretty Cure'; blaming this media on the rapid rise in girls saying they're bisexual or lesbians, and whether there's value in continuing to create such Anime if it's going to cause real girls to fail in love.

**The Hyperbola of SF and Shoujo Lovers  
The Recipe for 2D-Complex**​

**By Azagami Manabu (安座上学)**  
  
Before I stuck my neck into the Anime world, I was a young man with a laughable ego. The same time I was feeling unease about my own predilection towards girls, I also nursed a private sense of superiority.  
  
However, when I started stepping in and out of the editorial department of Animec, 'you're also a Lolicon~♪ I'm a Lolicon too～♪', it was a bargain sale of Lolita Complex to the point I deluded myself into thinking there were only Shoujo lovers in our society. In such a state, there was no longer neither aesthetics nor immorality. A competent young man by day and a young man who wandered the moonlit city in search of girls at night, I found the beauty of Shoujo hunting in a Moonlight Mask-ish (月光仮面) duality; I had revealed my base self and joined their party. The self-expression of SF fans and Anime fans were so indifferent and absent-minded, it was inevitable. In fact, today at this moment, if you aren't a Lolicon in the Imperial City, you couldn't call yourself an SF fan!  
**Moonlight Mask ([Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%88%E5%85%89%E4%BB%AE%E9%9D%A2))**  
  
One example of there being many Lolicon among SF fans. This is the experience of a 26 year-old SF fan at TOKON VII (the 1979 SF convention). After the first day was over, those who slipped out of their training camp ventured out to the porno shops in Asakusa. Of course, what they sought were those kinds of imported goods. However, everywhere the young man went, just the books that featured models around 10 years old were sold out, and at the last shop he stopped at, there was a corner that separated models by age, but there wasn't a single book left in the corner between 5 to 15 years old. Incredulous, the young man asks.  
  
"Excuse me, do you have any photobooks of girls around 10 years old—?"  
  
"Aah, guys with the same badges (for SF convention participants) as you bought 'em all. I have some 18 year-olds over here, how do you reckon? They're uncensored～."  
  
"No thanks, I don't want 'em."  
  
"That's what they all say～."  
  
Shocked, the young man confirmed the next day's shipment and returned to his training camp in good faith. Then tomorrow arrives. He left the convention in the early afternoon and headed to the porno shop from the night before, but this time, the Shoujo porno mags were bought out by another group who arrived as soon as the shop opened. Left with no choice, he thought he would have to make do with 5 year-olds... and when he shifted his gaze to its shelf, they were also all sold out that day, make of that what you will.  
  
This is a very extreme story, but I bet there's countless similar legends among our readers. As for me, whilst driving, a line formation of elementary schoolgirls caught my eye and I ignored the traffic signal. Every day, I'm surrounded by friends who purposefully bump into girls and utter 'oops, I'm sorry' in an attempt to touch their bodies. So what kind of correlation do you expect between SF and Girl Lover Syndrome? What does Shoujo mean to Anime fans?  
  
A noteworthy work by Brian W. Aldiss is available. 'The Hand-Reared Boy' (手育てられた少年) published by Sanrio SF Bunko. If you're a reader of this magazine, you likely do not need an explanation, but Aldiss, known for his 'The Long Afternoon of Earth' (地球の長い午後), is the standard-bearer of British New Wave SF. 'Hand-Reared' is a work that depicts his adolescence. Unlike his SF, it's a middle-brow novel rich in its auto-biographical hue. It depicts the sexual development of a middle-class boy named Horatio. Of course, due to his age, there are many instances of his partners being girls. Hand-reared means sexual experience via foreplay and masturbation before sexual intercourse. A boyhood full of joyous sexual experiences against a backdrop of a rural town in England during World War II. Anyone who is a man undoubtedly turned the pages of this book with nostalgia for their childhood. It is worth noting the formative experience of Aldiss's SF is playing 'Farmer-san and Cow-kun' (in short, a variant of playing Doctor). For Aldiss, his first sense of wonder was such a sexual experience where a female friend touched their own small genitals and the pleasure he recalled from when he knew the girls' genitals were opening.  
  
"Even at such a tender age, like an adult, I thought little of anything but sex (Translation: Ishihara Takeshi [石原武])."  
  
Couldn't you say the driving force that led Aldiss to SF was the joy he experienced towards girls' genitals?  
  
My theory is the SF mind is one born through the Law of Causality. The SF nature of each person forms depending on the intensity of their emotional experiences during childhood (particularly sexual instincts, curiosity, creative instincts, and experiences with bodily pleasure). Such childhood experiences are the original sense of wonder. Eventually, he'll grow up and discover SF on the shelves of his library. When he opens the pages, what he finds is the lingering scent of the original sense of wonder from his childhood. The pleasure of emotional experience submerged in his subconscious is revived by reading SF (and watching SF movies). Upon which, the outline of him becoming an SF-addict. Of course, for humans who don't possess the original SF experience, they won't understand the true taste of SF.  
  
Scenes like the above can be witnessed in Azuma Hideo's 'How I Made SF' (こうして私はSFした), but the second encounter in SF is a very similar case for everyone. Azuma Hideo symbolically shows the characteristics of SF quite well in the scene where Esuko-chan (S) secretly meets in the rental bookstore to transform into the Shoujo called Efuko-chan (F).  
  
This sort of SF writer nostalgia is not limited to Aldiss. What's more, the writer Ray Bradbury, who excelled at depicting boys, made us realise curiosity is the driving force behind SF. Vladimir Nabokov, the original author of 'Lolita' and the most fixated on 'memory', went the other way by writing SF and exposed the correlation between memory and SF.  
  
It is clear the origin of Lolita Complex lies in our childhood experience with the opposite sex. (Without Annabel, Lolita wouldn't have been born.) Shoujo lovers are beings who cannot escape the shadow of the girls (the age difference differs between individuals) that were romantic objects from when they were boys. Which means they're strong proprietors of those emotional experiences from when they were boys. In this sense, a formula is created where Shoujo lovers are the type best suited to reading SF. (For real?) However, this alone cannot explain the swarm of Shoujo lovers and Bishounen lovers (these are girls of course) spreading throughout the Imperial City. In fact, it may be true most of them have a 2D-Complex where they hide themselves in the world of film, unable to touch the real opposite sex, rather than being the proprietors of pure aesthetics. Where can a city child surrounded by concrete find the space to play Doctor? I feel the SF they encounter is slightly different from ours.  
  
However, upon careful consideration, I don't think it's good to be called Lolicon. I believe today's Shoujo lovers use this word too readily. If you apply this sort of discriminatory term to yourself and accept it, you will not awaken as a true Shoujo lover. Wouldn't it be unfortunate for Shoujo lovers to forever be confused with 2D-Complex? It should be possible for us to take a more creative approach (don't get any weird ideas).  
  
Lewis Carroll, Poe, Nabokov...  
  
We have great predecessors. Our aesthetics—thank the heavens for our ability to single out a handful of nymphets among dozens of girls in class photos—is infinitely expansive.

**What I Think of People Who Mock Japan as a 'Hentai Lolicon Superpower' and Debase it as a Wicked Country.** ​

  
  
Happy New Year.  
  
Living in Ireland, I'm also spending my New Years at a Manga café with Omochi in hand.  
  
Well, even on New Year's Eve when the new year begins, people are clamouring to complain about my tweets on Twitter. On the topic concerning the **'good security of Japan'**.  
  
In Japan, **Moe-style Anime posters are hanging everywhere throughout the city and magazines with questionable covers are remorselessly being sold in convenience stores, and feminists are shouting 'sexual exploitation of women and children! Environmental sexual harassment!' and foreign media are mocking us as a Hentai Lolicon Superpower. Recently, voices were raised lamenting that in the Global Gender Gap Index 2019, our country is ranked the lowest at 121st place.**  
  
Back when I was living in Japan, I also thought Japan had a low cultural level while Europe and America were advancing nicely. However, after living in Europe and raising my children, I noticed something.  
  
  
**Japan is full of so many questionable things, so why is it incredibly safe?**  
  
  
Children in Japan aren't obligated to be accompanied by a guardian when going to school, and it is normal for children to go to school alone or in groups with other children. It's normal for parents to let their children play in the park or run errands for them.  
  
Overseas, children are expected to be accompanied by their guardian at all times. For example, even in supposedly nice and safe areas where all the embassies of the world are lined up, there are muttering drunks, drug addicts, and perverts bumbling about. Pickpockets, purse-snatchers, and robbers are commonplace, and crimes are committed around the corner.  
  
Now that these feelings have become a matter of fact for me, it makes me shudder just thinking about back when I, myself, was a child going out to play alone and returning home on the dark roads by myself. Tentatively, **I googled the crime rate in Japan, and according to the UNODC survey in 2016, it was ranked 193 out of 195 in the world, statistically making it a wonderful and safe country.**  
  
Compared to 40 years ago when I was a child, I feel modern parents of Japan have a slight sense of danger, but even then, **guardians aren't obligated to pick up and drop off their children. In Japan, where guardians are never reported for neglect even if they let their child watch the house alone, this safeness is astounding.** On the other hand, the actual rate of sexual crimes against children is overwhelmingly high overseas, so it makes my stomach churn with anger seeing overseas media mock Japan.  
  
When I muttered this, people came out of the woodwork to tell me 'there's incidents where if you take your eyes off them for a moment, children in the park will be bullied in the toilet' and 'the elderly are volunteering to patrol cause they're scared of people threatening to murder children', but overseas, 'taking your eyes off them for a moment' is outrageous, **it's 'you can't let them out of your sight for even a split second'**, and even in such an environment, it would be strange to rely on elderly volunteers.  
  
Some might say, 'no, even if a sexual crime occurs in Japan, it's difficult for victims to raise their voices so it's not counted in the crime rate!', **but those people won't explain why the MeToo Movement happened in developed Western countries, or how the Catholic clergy around the world has been sexually abusing children for a long time, keeping it secret until it recently came to light.** So such a statement isn't 'limited to Japan'. Speaking of which, in the documentary film 'Female Pleasure' on the theme of women's discrimination issues that I'm appearing in, the German writer Doris Wagner, who accused a priest of sexually abusing her from a young age, is also appearing, but her accusation was dismissed by the church, and her trial was also dismissed by her country, so even now, she continues to fight them. (By the way, this is a woman in a developed country ranked 10th on the Gender Gap Index.)  
**Female Pleasure ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_Pleasure))  
  
Unfortunately, it's a fact 'sex criminals and perverts exist in every country', and 'sex victims finding it difficult to accuse them of their wrongdoing has no relation to country or race'.** Nevertheless, with the recent development of SNS, it has become easier for individual victims to raise their voices. Even in Japan, a demonic journalist called Hirokawa Ryuuichi (広河隆一) has been socially punished, and women have come forward to accuse him of raping them under their real names (despite the bashing). Society is slowly, but surely, improving.  
  
In addition, shouldn't we praise each other more and be proud of the fact Japan, which allows children to have so much freedom, has such a low crime rate and is safe? **Of course, we mustn't become complacent, so if we steadily improve the environment for parents to accompany their children, Japan will be able to further reduce its sexual crime rate against children. However, this talk of restricting Moe-illustrations and questionable magazines is absolutely ridiculous.**  
  
With that said, it's time to celebrate the start of a new year, so to the people who want to say Japan is a wicked country, and to the feminists who want to say 'Japanese men (limited to ugly old men and Otaku) are evil!', even if their streets aren't overflowing with questionable things, **even if their Gender Gap Index is high, when compared to developed countries like Europe and America where crime is happening around the corner, how about giving notice to the positive aspect of living in a safe and secure country?**  
  
I don't think there's much happiness to continue living while cursing the country you reside in.

1981 SPOT PEOPLE  
4th: Clarisse  
Character Setting: Miyazaki Hayao  
​
They say the 'Lolicon' fad is concentrating on Clarisse, but I feel that has nothing to do with me. However, young people these days are using Lolicon to mean 'yearning'. Everyone has such an experience during adolescence. In my case, there was a period I yearned for Bai-Niang (白娘) from 'The White Snake Enchantress' (白蛇伝). Though I graduated from that a year later (laughs). I believe it's something like that. Also, we didn't 'play' with our yearnings, and furthermore, we were embarrassed to talk about them openly. We had 'shame', you see? Whether that's good or not is another matter, but in any case, I don't like men who say 'Lolicon'.**

**I often see this referenced in academic papers. This is for a character poll, and Clarisse won 4th place for one of the categories during a poll held in 1981. From what I can tell from a 6 month old reddit post, Brenten is scanning Animage, Animec, and OUT, so eventually the entire issue will be available on his Internet Archive account page (****Archive Link****). If you watched Okada's video about Fist of the North Star's theme being Lolicon, he also shares a couple other things. The first being Monkey Punch, the original author of the Lupin the Third manga, did not like Miyazaki Hayao's film adaptation. Second, Takahashi Rumiko did not like the Beautiful Dreamer film adaptation of her Urusei Yatsura manga. Both of their reasoning has to do with the quality and the level of disrespect to the characters in the source material.  
  
Until Brenten gets around to it, you can see the other polls that were split between male and female readers, and some scans of the Animage issue here (**[**Link**](https://retoge-mag.websa.jp/archives/285)**). The scans are kinda too small for reading.**

**There's hundreds of these small fan magazines, and as far as I can tell, no one has archived them. The following is a fan interviewing Tezuka Osamu about his works, and I translated the interview questions regarding the serial he was doing in Akitashoten's Shounen Champion. I'm still searching for stuff related to Tezuka on the topic of Azuma Hideo, since out of all the Mangaka, the one they say Tezuka considered to be his peer in terms of influence is Azuma Hideo. Tezuka is well-known for having a competitive spirit, hence the nature of his work that was being serialised alongside Uchiyama Aki's 'Andoro Trio'.**  
  
**■Regarding 'Prime Rose'**  
  
——Right now, 'Prime Rose' is what you're doing, but are you going to be doing it between breaks on a year-by-year basis?  
  
**Tezuka:** "I promise I won't take a break for a whole year. Even if it turns out to be unpopular, I won't take a break; I'll make it better without any breaks."  
  
——There's critiques of your character that she's a Third-rate Gekiga one, but what do you have to say?  
  
**Tezuka:** "I'm doing that on purpose. You could say I'm being very cheap and vulgar (laughs). The plot may make you think it'll be a simple Gekiga, but in fact, you'll eventually realise it's very much an SF story. Its punch line is like the finale in W3, I don't think it'll be quite understandable until right before the very end. It's going to be getting more vulgar from here. The vulgarity is such it makes me wonder if I'm the one who drew this, but I'm doing it on purpose, so please read it to the very end."  
**W3 by Tezuka Osamu ([Link](https://tezukaosamu.net/jp/manga/588.html))**  
  
——I feel like Sensei is still following the path he's been treading, but both the Lolicon Boom and SF Boom are products created by Sensei's Manga, so now that they've ripened, it feels like Sensei, himself, is following them again.  
  
**Tezuka:** "Let me put it to you this way, it looks like I'm riding the Lolicon Boom and various other booms, but you see, I'm merely taking advantage of them. In the case of the Lolicon Boom, I've never drawn with the theme of a Lolicon Manga. For example, suppose it's robots, I wouldn't draw a Robot Manga for robots. I'm just using them as a tool, you see. My true intention is that I'm planning to draw something else. For example, 'Dororo', I'm wondering if Dororo is Lolicon (laughs). Pinoko is fine, but supposing Pinoko is Lolicon, then Pinoko's style of Lolicon should be utilised more. However, that's just garnish for sashimi. I'm not creating 'Prime Rose' for Lolicon, there's more than that I want to tell the reader."

> ——"I'm of the opinion Takemiya Keiko's 'Fly Me to the Moon!' is the perfect Lolicon manga."

Takemiya Keiko's 'Fly Me to the Moon' ([**Wikipedia**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A7%81%E3%82%92%E6%9C%88%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A7%E9%80%A3%E3%82%8C%E3%81%A6%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6!)) is a Shoujo Manga with a science fiction plot loosely based on Robert Young's 'The Dandelion Girl'. Another female Mangaka called Nakata Aki (中田雅喜; [**Wikipedia**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E7%94%B0%E9%9B%85%E5%96%9C)) did an ero-parody of 'Fly Me to the Moon' involving Hirukogami Ken. This was originally serialised in Manga Burikko (漫画ブリッコ), but was compiled in Nakata's 'Pink Triangle' (桃色三角). The compilation has been remastered and is available for sale on Mandarake ([**Shop Link**](https://www.mandarake.co.jp/ariaru/shop/en/item/1184379871)).

The original manga by Takemiya Keiko flaunts a relationship between the main heroine, Nina Flexible, who has ESP powers, and an American Air Force Major and NASA Class A pilot, Dan Mild. They have a 17 year age difference, and the word Lolita pops up on occasion. Trying to explain the complexities of the story beyond it being loosely based on The Dandelion Girl would probably take an hour long video.

**The 'Lolicon' Boom That Has Come This Far. Let's Follow the Front Line!**​

Lolicon is so prevalent among Anime fans right now, it makes one ask 'are all male Anime fans Lolicon!?'. Speaking of which, what exactly is Lolicon? Short special feature that returns to the origins of the boom once again and ponders it. Interview with Uchiyama Aki!

![[Pasted image 20250501205213.png]]

**①Let's ask the person who knows the most about Lolicon, Yonezawa Yoshihiro, "why is there 'Lolicon' now!?".**

![[Pasted image 20250501205243.png]]

**Pic: Yonezawa  
  
An article published in the 1980 December issue of 'OUT' titled 'Manga Modernology for Sick People Issue 1: Lolita Complex' is said to have been the impetus for popularising the term 'Lolicon' among Anime fans. The man who wrote that article——Yonezawa is also in charge of the Comic Market Organising Committee where many Doujinshi gather. We tried asking about the beginning of the Lolicon Boom among Anime fans from the beginning to present.**  
  
AM: "How many Lolicon fanzines (Doujinshi) are being exhibited at Comiket?"  
  
Yonezawa: "About 30 out of about 700 total. Compared to before, they have increased considerably, but it seems they're about to hit a plateau."  
  
AM: "Even magazines such as 'GORO' and 'NON・NO' have started putting together Lolicon special features."  
  
Yonezawa: "You could say the word 'Lolicon' has become more open. The trend entered the 1970s with singers like Minami Saori (南沙織) and Yamaguchi Momoe (山口百恵), essentially cute girls singing risque lyrics, but it has considerably progressed from the social background where it was once considered strange. In other words, the word Lolicon itself has lost the dark image it once had."  
  
AM: "The reason it became popular among Anime fans was because of Clarisse's extraordinary popularity in 'Castle of Cagliostro', right?"  
  
Yonezawa: "Right. The current boom started around the Doujinshi called 'Clarisse Magazine' becoming famous. Before it trended, there was first a Bishounen Boom that centred on girls, followed by parodies that became mainstream, and lastly a Lolicon Boom that centred on boys. If I were to simply describe this Anime Lolicon, it would be play by boys based on Bishoujo characters from Anime."  
  
AM: "However, Clarisse and Angie have completely different personalities, but they're grouped together as Lolicon because they're cute."  
  
Yonezawa: "In the end, the definition of Lolicon in Anime is not clear because there are a lot of individual differences due to personal likes and dislikes."  
  
AM: "By the way, the contents of the 'play' in Doujinshi are pretty mindblowing. There's even nude and lesbian scenes with Clarisse and Lana."  
  
Yonezawa: "At first, they rode with nudes of Clarisse as parody, but probably due to the influence of 'Ero Gekiga', they turned into violent depictions. This is because a simple parody would soon get boring. So when they started thinking about what could work as a serious parody, it escalated into Lolicon Doujinshi with very intense content. In the end, Anime and Manga Bishoujo characters made for the most handy material."  
  
AM: "Nowadays, there are many people who've gone beyond Lolicon and developed a '2D-Complex', where they can only love Bishoujo depicted in art."  
  
Yonezawa: "Yeah. Liking the erotic scenes in Manga and Anime and thinking the girls in Shounen Manga and Shoujo Manga are cute isn't particularly strange. But who knows if they're directly attracted to just that. Rather, I believe it's better to think of Anime and Manga Bishoujo as easy targets for parody. That's what probably caused this boom. However, I believe this boom will also subside considerably by summer of this year at Comiket. As one might expect, when the number of Doujinshi increases, they're likely to grow tired of it."  
  
**※  
  
After listening to Yonezawa's remarks, I decided to take a peek at Comiket 20 (Held at Harumi, Tokyo, on March 21st), but Lolicon Doujinshi turned out to be as popular as ever, and there were a notable number of them, along with fanzines related to 'Six God Combination Godmars' (六神合体ゴッドマーズ). There were also men crossdressing as girls, making me believe the roots of their 'Sickness' run quite deep.  
  
N-kun, a long-time Circle member at Comiket, says, "It's sad that Doujinshi centred on serious work research like the ones in the past have all but disappeared. The 'Yamato' and 'Gundam' fanclubs have all been swept up in the Lolicon mainstream, it felt like I was in a different age." So I asked him if the Lolicon Boom ends this summer like Yonezawa predicted, what would be the next boom? N-kun replied, "Nobody has the ability to predict that now."**

**Now you know what a Lanacon and a Hildacon are～.  
It seems I should translate the Waseda University article.  
Here's some info about their 'Anicom' Doujinshi ([Link](http://www.burikko.net/people/anicom.html)).  
  
②The King of 'Lolicon' and Diaper Manga, Uchiyama Aki's fans are surprisingly made up of mostly middle schoolgirls!**

![[Pasted image 20250501205349.png]]

**Pic: Uchiyama Aki  
  
Among those that have been highlighted among Yonezawa reviews in 'OUT' is Uchiyama. It can be said he is the No.1 at selling Lolicon Manga as he handles 160 pages by himself every month. The manga that feature cute girls in diapers are very popular among middle schoolgirls. I visited that Uchiyama at his home (on the second floor of a Tonkatsu restaurant in Sugamo, Tokyo).**  
  
  
AM: "However, 160 pages a month is incredible. For a normal Mangaka, the average is..."  
  
Uchiyama: "I suppose around 40~60. Well, I like drawing, so I just keep drawing and drawing."  
  
AM: "Though since all of them are Lolicon Manga, you must be hearing voices saying 'it must be getting boring'."  
  
Uchiyama: "Actually, I didn't know the word Lolicon when I first started drawing Manga. Somehow, it was by circumstance I had orders to do Girl Manga. Then one day, I was asked by an editor 'Uchiyama-san, do you know Lolicon?' to which I said 'nope' (laughs). So it was around 1979 when I started consciously drawing little girls for 'OUT'."  
  
AM: "Meaning, you became a Lolicon Mangaka before you realised it?"  
  
Uchiyama: "Right. Then I found out one of the tools for SM play were diapers and when I drew a Manga using them, it turned out to be strangely lewd and interesting. I even received fan letters from girls saying the diapers were nice."  
  
AM: "It's interesting the fans coming to Uchiyama-san's Manga are girls."  
  
Uchiyama: "After all, it's hard to draw erotica directly in Shoujo Manga. I suppose that's why girls filled with curiosity take cursory peeks at Shounen Manga and Ero-Manga."  
  
AM: "Meaning the Lolicon element has already been accepted by even girls?"  
  
Uchiyama: "Lolicon is based on the desire to move things that cannot resist to one's will. I believe that desire is universally within everyone's heart. At the same time, sexual desire is as natural as being alive. Those desires were suppressed around the time I was a middle schooler, when my sexual curiosity was at its strongest. I believe the only way for boys and girls to incorporate sexual things is in the form of Lolicon. So I don't believe there's as much of a Lolicon Boom as people say. Looking at the history of Manga, Lolicon Manga isn't that great, but whatever form it takes in the future, I believe Lolicon will survive."

![[Pasted image 20250501205425.png]]

**Lolicon magazines had a substantial female readership and plenty of the artists drawing for those magazines were women. Shoujo magazine editors were pretty strict back then, so those sorts of magazines were the testing grounds for Shoujo Smut before regular Shoujo Manga editors allowed that stuff to be published.  
  
Been trying to find ways to nicely tie in the Yaoi (Bishounen Boom) fandom of the old Comiket whose participants were 90% female for the 1st Comiket with the Bishoujo (Lolicon Boom) fandom. One could say the Year 24 Flower Group and Yaoi Doujinshi acted as the flowerbed for Lolicon Doujinshi, since ero-parodies involving male Anime characters gave male artists the courage to try their own ero-parodies with Bishoujo characters. Azuma Hideo taking this out of Comiket and into commercial magazines was also pivotal in allowing BL (Boy's Love) to eventually be accepted by magazine editors and published commercially.**

**The Lolicon Syndrome Over University Students**​

  
**By Iwata Kaoru  
  
Iwata Kaoru is described by the Manga Burikko blogger as a reportage writer, but searching for his name leads to a politician going by the same name. Looking at Kaoru's author page on Amazon.co.jp (**[**Amazon**](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E5%B2%A9%E7%94%B0-%E8%96%AB/e/B004KXUFUI)**) makes me believe they may be the same person. 'Monthly The Ushio' is a general magazine, and while it's still being printed in 2022 (**[**Link**](https://www.usio.co.jp/magazines/ushio)**), there's no archive list of their older magazines. This is what their 1988 September issue looks like to get an impression of its tone:**

![[Pasted image 20250501205531.png]]

**The Burikko blogger also stresses there are a couple factual inaccuracies in this article, but doesn't specify which parts are inaccurate. However, it does depict the activities of university clubs and legendary figures such as Hirukogami Ken and Aoyama Masaaki when they were young men.**

![[Pasted image 20250501205613.png]]

**■Unable to Date Female University Students on Equal Footing**  
  
Northwest of the capital, past the trees near the sacred precincts of Waseda, a strange Circle called the 'Virgin Alliance' was launched April of this year. The official name of the Circle is 'Waseda University Virgin Alliance・New Special Committee for Sexual Culture and Purification'.  
  
The moment it was established, they erected a boldly written sign next to the bronze statue of Marquis Okuma saying, 'Chancellor Shimizu! Please make us men'. It further reads, 'We'll protect honourable virgins, promote the status of virgins, protect female virgins from wolves, and bring the hammer down on men and women who have sex as fashion'.  
  
Ishida Makoto-kun (3rd Year, 1st Literary Department) says this.  
  
"Last year, according to a certain mini-communication magazine survey, two-thirds of Waseda's students were virgins when they graduated. 80~90 percent of 1st year undergrads were virgins. As a result, the number of shy, withdrawn, and meek students are increasing. We established this club to give them courage. Our primary active policy is the pursuit of virginity (the way of life for virgins), and secondly, to protect members from the vile hands of female students."  
  
June of this year, two months after the 'Virgin Alliance' was launched, 15 female university students from 12 universities formed their own 'Nice Middle Research Club'.  
  
The club was established with the main idea 'there's already too many weak male students. Let's learn from the Nice Middle we admire'. Watari Tesuya (渡哲也), Tsuyuguchi Shigeru (露口茂), Kobayashi Akira (小林旭), and Fuji Tatsuya (藤竜也) among other middle-aged men with a 'scent of danger' were selected as their ideal men. Members visit the production and record companies these men belong to, working diligently on 'activities' where they collect posters and coloured papers.  
  
"Whenever we enter a Saten **(Kissaten; Tea House)**, they fluster over what to order. Anyways, boys these days aren't clear at all. They're indecisive and very stingy. We're ashamed of being from the same generation as them. Unlike them, a nihilistic and lone wolf-type Nice Middle is far more charming. If possible, we would like to have a close relationship with a man like that... that's why we created this club." (Manager Yamamoto Yumiko-san [山本由美子]=Pseudonym=Hosei University Literature Department 2nd Year)  
  
The 'Virgin Alliance' and 'Nice Middle Research Club', it can be said these two represent the typical Circles that symbolise the recent student spirit. Women grew stronger in inverse proportion to men growing weaker... This is the undeniable reality of campuses in the 1980s.  
  
As a result, where did the male students, unable to have an 'equal' relationship with their fellow female students, flee? You guessed it, they found their answer in 'Lolicon' that is experiencing a big boom.  
  
Lolicon. Its official name is 'Lolita Complex'. Translated to Japanese, you could call it a predilection towards Shoujo, or Shoujo Fancier. The origin of the term is the novel 'Lolita' written by Eastern European-born Vladimir Nabokov in 1955. This novel is a work whose sensational contents depict a story of a 50-year old university professor becoming beguiled by a 12 year-old girl and drowning in sexual love, but connected to this, people started calling men who long for Bishoujo 'Lolicon'.  
  
It's been nearly two years since Lolicon trended on campuses, coupled with the increasing percentage of virgins among university students, it gradually grew in power as male students became unable to talk to female students the same age as them. One theory is that students who weren't adept at written tests, due to the influence of the preliminary standard university entrance examination, began to avoid their cheeky and argumentative peers, even when having negotiations with girls, and turned to younger girls 'who'll obediently listen to what they say'.  
  
  
**■Rebellious Lolicon Manga**  
  
The direct instigator of the Lolicon Boom are Manga Doujinshi created by the hands of students.  
  
In Tokyo, Comic Market, which can be called an exhibition and sales of these Manga Doujinshi, is held three times a year. Among the exhibition magazines that can be said to number between one to two thousand, Doujinshi which introduced the Bishoujo from Anime and the cute protagonists from Shoujo Manga, cut-and-pasted as they were, began to appear all over.  
  
"Comic Market currently has 20~30 Doujinshi specialising in Lolicon and they're thriving. For example, one of them is called 'Youjo Fancier' (幼女嗜好). A young man called Hirukogami Ken is releasing them, and they say he's the first human to advocate for the civil rights of Lolicon in Comic Market. What's more, he dresses in hunting cap, sunglasses, mask, and a raincoat, and people call out to him at exhibition and spot sale venues with 'Nii-san, there's an interesting Doujinshi here'. His reception is so enthusiastic there's even dummies showing up now..." (Freelance Writer Mihiro Kuruto [三尋狂人].)  
  
Publishing companies that print established Manga magazines have taken notice in the popularity of the Lolicon in this Manga Doujinshi world. Among them, 'Shounen Champion' is featuring a creator called Uchiyama Aki (内山亜紀) and has serialised his Lolicon Manga, which has gathered overwhelming support. In addition, following this Uchiyama Aki as Lolicon Mangaka, Azuma Hideo and Taniguchi Kei are currently active. Nowadays, they're even releasing magazines specialising in Lolicon such as 'Lemon People' (Amatoria-sha) and 'Hey Buddy'.  
  
On the other side, Tankoubon that introduce and analyse the Lolicon Boom from the side are being published. The 'Lolicon Complete Works' (Gunyusha Publishing) released May of this year, and 'Lolicon Hakusho' (Byakuya Shobo) released in July are among them.  
  
For the former, Hirukogami Ken, who lit the fire of the Lolicon Doujinshi Boom mentioned earlier, has been appointed as a supervisor. With a Shoujo dress-up doll in the appendix, the work is filled with Bishoujo nudes, basic knowledge of Lolicon terminology, and articles such as a high schoolgirl roundtable talk. For the latter, it's a reprint of the designs and articles related to Lolicon from Manga and Anime Doujinshi with the catchphrase 'Lolicon Doujinshi Best Collection'. I visited Gunyusha Publishing in Kanda, the publisher of the 'Lolicon Complete Works', and spoke to Yamada Hiroyoshi-san (山田博良) (42 years-old) of the Editorial department. Yamada-san opened the door by explaining the average image of the Lolicon youth into the following four elements.  
  
These are the four elements. 1) They don't know women (virgins). 2) Feminine in personality. 3) Timid and unable to do bad things. 4) Grades are top class in school.  
  
"Originally, there are many Lolicon among those who would ride the main current of society's elite course. For example, Tokyo University. There are students at Tokyo University recording all the TV commercials that show Bishoujo models and talents, and making a list of them. I believe the books we publish are accepted by youngsters because they're seeking the 'innocence' found in Bishoujo not found in adult women."  
  
  
**■Many in High-Ranking Universities**  
  
Allow me to give the best evidence for the point Lolicon students stand out in national universities and high-ranking private universities. Known as Tokyo University's Unique Circle, the 'Idol Production Research Club' investigated and released the results of an opinion survey asking for the idol image among Tokyo University students.

The 'Idol Research' was launched in May 1980 with the motto 'Let's Create Stars with Our Own Hands'. So far, they held an 'Idol Contest Selected by Tokyo University Students' on the campus's gorgeous pasture for grazing horses, where they had amateur middle, high, and university schoolgirls compete twice. The opinion survey mentioned above when they held this contest is only for reference purposes only. As you can see from the results, a 'slim, white-coloured, catty and cute female' is captured as their idol. Meaning, it's nothing other than Lolicon-oriented. Names such as Matsumoto Iyo and Yakushimaru Hiroko can be construed as their taste in Bishoujo.  
  
Actually, during the '2nd Idol Contest' held in December of last year, out of the 1200 applicants, a 14 year-old middle school first year girl, Takeda Kumiko (武田久美子), was selected for the Grand Prix, and it could be her selection was deeply rooted in Lolicon-orientation.  
  
"The motivation for creating our club was we wanted to show a real gal bursting with youth and energy to Tokyo University students who had few opportunities to interact with normal girls. That's why we changed the method of judging for the contest. For example, sumo wrestling. We had girls enter the sumo ring in Tokyo University's sumo club and compete dressed like that, it was pretty ridiculous." ('Idol Research' 2nd Generation Representative Wada Masaki [和田雅樹]=Third Year Law Student.)  
  
You could say the situation can already be referred to as Sick.  
  
What kind of symptoms does this Lolicon Syndrome show in universities besides Tokyo University? Here's another piece of interesting data. This is the result of the 'Lolicon Severity Survey' they compiled in July of this year with the cooperation of the campus magazine departments in each university. They used the format of having each mini-communication editor score their own university, and the results are quite amusing in their variety. (Refer to Table 3)  
  
**Table 3: Lolicon Condition at Each University  
  
University Name: Lolicon Severity and Campus Status  
  
Tokyo University:** ☆☆☆☆☆ Takeda Kumiko, who was sold by 'Tokyo University Idol Produce Research', is 13 years-old.  
  
**Hitotsubashi University:** ☆☆☆☆☆ More and more male students insert pictures of neighbourhood girls into their pass case.  
  
**Gakushuin University:** ☆☆☆☆ Often see scenes of them sitting on benches with elementary schoolers in a park near the university.  
  
**Waseda University:** ☆☆☆☆☆ There are so many Lolicon students it's said to be a university that granted civil rights to Lolicon. Percentage of virgins is also 70%.  
  
**Keio University:** ☆☆☆☆☆ Students are exiting the level of hobby and challenging Lolicon in real life.  
  
**Chuo University:** ☆☆☆ The campus is in the mountains. There are so few women, they have no choice but to flee to Lolicon!!?  
  
**Meiji University:** ☆☆☆ There's glimpses of Lolicon discussions in the student counselling office.  
  
**Kansai University:** ☆☆☆ There's countless Lolicon students in the engineering department. So those who tinker with machines have a high predilection for Shoujo!!?  
  
**Ritsumeikan University:** ☆☆☆☆☆ A hive of Lolicon. They're passing around and reading Lolicon Manga.  
  
**Doshisha University:** ☆ Everyone's popular with female university students, so there's few Lolicon. However, there's a few passionate fans of Ito Tsukasa and Matsumoto Iyo.  
  
**Kyoto University:** ☆☆☆☆☆ Lolicon is spreading so much there's a Circle called 'Sailor Suit Research'.  
  
  
The first thing you'll notice from this table is the fact Lolicon is spreading to elite schools such as Tokyo University, Hitotsubashi, Waseda, Keio, Gakushuin, Ritsumeikan, and Kyoto University.  
  
For example, Hitotsubashi University. There's a hidden trend among male students to secretly take photos of girls from the elementary school near their dorms and homes, and insert them in their pass case.  
  
"It has the sensation I'm committing a crime, or rather, I'm doing something naughty. I somehow agree with OB Tanaka Yasuo's (田中康夫) fetish of wearing those panties. As a university student suffering from the triple pain of 'unfashionable, unpopular, and unpitiful', don't you suppose this is the perfect sedative drug?" (Campus magazine 'Hitotsubashi Mercury' Editor Nakada Yuu-kun [中田勇君]=Third Year.)  
  
In Gakushuin's case, they're on the verge of falling ill. According to the staff of the campus magazine 'Shounen Gakushuin', it's said there's often scenes of them sitting on benches with girls from the neighbouring kindergartens while they're drinking beer in the parks near Big Box in Takadanobaba, playing and letting the girls ride on their shoulders. When they're called 'Ojisa~n', they look so happy it sends a chill down one's spine.  
  
In some cases where they're always forced to tinker with machines, like the engineering club at Kansai University, a tendency to prefer younger girls who moved at the flick of a switch like a machine appeared.  
  
"When I joined the engineering department, I became so busy, I don't have time to play with girls my own age. So, that's why I want a girl that'll be quiet and listen to what I say. The only girls who'll listen to me with no thoughts of their own are little girls." (Campus magazine 'Hot Corner' editorial department Niwa Toshihiro-kun [丹羽寿宏]=4th year sociology student.)  
  
Kyoto University is so famous as a mecca for Lolicon that it is called 'West Tokyo University'. Rivalling the Tokyo University's 'Idol Research', there's unique Circles even here. In addition to conducting comparative studies on middle and high schoolgirl sailor suits, they play a role as a liaison council for Matsuda Seiko, Matsumoto Iyo, and Yakushimaru Hiroko among others (concert information, and so on).  
  
Their largest annual event, which has a history of four years, is dozens of male executive committee members walking around the city dressed in sailor suits during the 'masquerade procession' that precedes the school festival every autumn. This has become a regular event.  
  
"We were borrowing used sailor suits from female university students, but everyone seems to fancy them. So we're considering a reexamination of the goodness of sailor suits as a form of fashion." (Association Representative Nishida Naohisa-kun [西田直久]=5th year science department.)  
  
I believe it's safe to say Lolicon Syndrome has taken a firm hold.  
  
  
**■University Students Waiting in front of Elementary Schools**  
  
Let's move the topic to students that have taken the form of Sick one step further.  
  
The stage is Waseda University. In the university, as of October of last year, a Lolicon research magazine crafted by the hands of the students is being published. The title is 'Supplementary Issue Anicom・For Shoujo Fanciers'. The publisher is the Waseda University Anime Club, which was established in April 1978. The group has thirty members split between three main activities. 1) The screenings of pre-existing Anime works. 2) The release of self-produced Anime. 3) The publishing of the Doujinshi 'Anicom'. 'Supplementary Issue Anicom', as part of this third activity, is edited by the hands of volunteers with certain interests among the group members.  
  
"There were Lolicon Doujinshi that introduced most of the cute protagonists in Anime, but there was nothing definitive. So, at the time, we thought we should release a comprehensive magazine and decided to to publish a Doujinshi." (Group member Terada Tooru-kun [寺田融]=Second year law department.)  
  
'Supplementary Issue Anicom' was so well-received the first edition in October last year was sold out, and the second printing was released in February of this year. They say they sold 1200~1300 copies, so you could say it is a best-seller in the mini-communication world. In terms of content, on the first page following the cover, you'll notice it drives home the definition of Lolicon by stating, "In this book, we don't call anything but girls under 14 years old 'Shoujo'."  
  
So, it runs the gamut from Anime heroines and diagrams of tampons for Shoujo to cute elementary schoolgirl uniforms and Tokyo's 17 elementary school uniform guide, it's filled with articles such as the Encyclopaedia of Youjo and Shoujo. The contents of the full-scale edition goes into intricate detail.  
  
"Among them, the 'Elementary School Uniform Special Feature' is illustrated referencing the many photos by members who deliberately went out of their way to the schools to take them. Many publishers have done similar since then, but we can say we were the first in this field. If you ask us, we believe Lolicon to be nothing creepy or nasty, but rather it's much more bright and cheerful." (Member Terada Youichi-kun [寺田洋一]=1st department 2nd year.)  
  
The image of a university student well in age standing in front of the gates of an elementary school taking photos of girls is undoubtedly strange indeed. However, it's still too early to be surprised. At Waseda, there's even a Circle called the 'Puffed Sleeves Club' whose goal is to share 'intimate conversation' with middle schoolgirls.  
  
As a separate organisation of the 'Waseda Shoujo Manga Research Club', they just started this spring. Their current members are four 1st year students.  
  
"As the name suggests, 'Shoujo Manga Research' is a club for reading and studying Shoujo Manga, but among the members, there's one guy who really liked middle schoolgirls, so we called for the formation of a new club as a joke, but we really started one." (Club vice-president Yoshimura Misaka-kun [よしむらみさか]=1st year politics and economics.)  
  
The 'Puffed Sleeves Club' was named to represent the opinions of Lolicon students who feel the puffed sleeves of sailor suits hold an indescribable innocence.  
  
The club activities are after school where the members venture to middle schools in Tokyo with a lowered 'Walkman Recorder' to have 'conversations' with budding middle schoolgirls. Of course, seeing them as suspicious university students, the girls run away. So they put on an 'exaggerated and stinky performance'.  
  
"Umm, excuse me. Do you know the way to the station?"  
  
When asking for directions in this fashion, they record the conversations of the girls answering on their Walkman, and afterwards, they play the tapes back to their buddies, competing and gloating over the sensuality and quality of the voices.  
  
"Selecting cute girls is a skill. A tacky surfer-cut is no good. I want a gal that looks like a middle schooler in her uniform. However, even though we converse with middle schoolgirls, we don't consider them as sexual objects. Rather we prefer to view ourselves as bodyguards that protect them. I dunno if you could call it a 'little sister desire'." (Previously mentioned, Yoshimura-kun.)  
  
You could they're also 'purity'-oriented.

**Cover of Waseda's 'Supplementary Issue Anicom: For Shoujo Fanciers' (October 1981). List of Anicom Covers and Information ([Link](https://ameblo.jp/rabit-gti/entry-12364269878.html)). In the 1982 February issue of OUT, they did a collaboration by creating a fictitious Anime project called 'Self-Defence Force Japanese' (自衛戦隊ジャパニーズ) about Bishoujo burning with patriotism, protecting Japan from foreign devils. It's supposed to be on p61, but I don't think I see it on this blog (**[**Link**](https://ameblo.jp/g-fock/entry-11927431840.html)**).  
  
■Keio University's 'Monomaniac Writer'**  
  
It was clear students yearning for innocence is deeply rooted. However, this consciousness needs to know that if you make a misstep, you may very well step into the realm of Hentai.  
  
I present to you a mini-communication that is a sample of that form. To put it bluntly, its name is 'Mutation' (突然変異). It is published by 'Mutation Company' (突然変異社) run mainly by the students of Keio University.  
  
In the same magazine, they composed an article called '6th grader 4th class new opening' in the second issue published last year, and under the headline of 'I'm a Slave Volunte~er', there's a message from an elementary schoolgirl with her photograph that was well-received.  
  
"Well, it would be troubling having our magazine seen as equal to a Lolicon magazine. Among our writers, there's one monomaniac Lolicon human we happened to have write articles." (Magazine editor, Nishimura Teruo-kun [西村照夫]=4th year literary department.)  
  
I met that 'Monomaniac Writer' in a tea house in Shinjuku. His name is Aoyama Masaaki (青山正明) (4th year law student). My impression from looking at him is that he's a very normal young man.  
  
He stepped into this world when he was a middle school student. Nursing an interest in child pornography, he ordered magazines from Europe and enjoyed them by his lonesome. Currently, he's a student writer undertaking Tankoubon related to Lolicon while serialising the sequel to the '6th Year 4th Group Class Newspaper' in 'Hey Buddy', the aforementioned Lolicon commercial magazine.  
  
"I guess it was around when I entered university. I've gotten really interested in stuff like elementary schooler canvas shoes, or pieces of gum that had been chewed up and spat out in addition to used sanitary napkins... So, I collected those things and continued life whilst indulging in masturbation in my bedroom. The napkins were collected from the school toilets during sports day, but it's kinda hard getting around the notion some of them may belong to the PTA. Direct sex with children? I sometimes think about trying, but can't quite muster the ambition. Though I may consider it if there's a chance I'll never get caught."  
  
What an extreme statement. According to him, he says when it comes to adult women these days 'there's parts he can't stand such as how thickly they pad themselves with make-up'. I wonder if that's what turned him into a Lolicon. But tidying up the problem with just this doesn't go down well with me. Because in real life he's properly living with a woman the same age as him. I was shocked when he told me his female partner is fully aware of his Lolicon-orientation. You could say either modern young women are somehow progressive or that they're very understanding...  
  
  
**■Reverse Flow Injection of Mothercon**  
  
So why do you suppose Lolicon students spread so rapidly on campus? There's certainly a history that a desire for sailor suits and other fetishism have captured adults in Japan since long ago. However, it would be best to say those were a kind of morbid play for middle and old age men past 50. The problem with the Lolicon that is currently trending is that most of its fans are university students who are supposed to be the most sexually open in their 20s.  
  
Known for receiving consultations regarding sexual problems from young people over the telephone, Oojimi Toshihide (大慈彌俊英), the hospital director from the 'Daijimi Clinic' (Tokyo, Ikebukuro), analysed it this way.  
  
"The overwhelming majority of the current youth (as the nuclear family advances) are the eldest sons of their family. Meanwhile, mothers themselves stick out as the spoiled type raised as the only daughter. As a result, a mother complex has nestled itself in quite a few male students. I believe Lolicon is a reverse flow injection of this Mothercon."  
  
Regarding the analysis that the increase in the number of eldest sons is behind the Lolicon Boom, the writer, Fukiage Ryuuichirou (吹上流一郎), concurs. He continues and points out that 'this is the best evidence we entered a period where men have become gentler'.  
  
"In other words, boys are much too kind to girls the same age as them and have lost their identity. It's precisely because they cannot meet them one-on-one that they have stepped into the Lolicon world where they can take a 'leading' position to girls younger than them. Just the other day, I happened to peek into a group meeting of people with psychosomatic disorders, and I recall being quite surprised most of the attendees were the eldest sons of their respective families."  
  
Though there's no evidence Lolicon is one stage of a psychosomatic disorder, In the scheme that Kyouiku Mama→Examination War→Uniform First‐round Entrance Examination... When you connect the social conditions in which modern university students grew up, you cannot help but feel like you understand the reason why Lolicon is so prevalent.

**While they're not mentioned in the article, this was a project by the students of Tokai University's Manga Research Club. No one knows the exact year in the 1980s they created this, and the source quality is pretty poor. It's a parody of 'Super Dimension Fortress Macross' and 'Her Majesty's Petite Angie' to create the Valkyrie Langie (Rangie?) to fight a giant (Rusher Kimura; a Japanese pro wrestler). Minky Momo, whose anime was being broadcast a few months before Anicom's Anime Lolicon Severity Chart, also appears. Angie's anime wasn't popular during its original 1977~78 broadcast, though Azuma Hideo's interest in the character caused it to boom in popularity afterwards with his 'Hyper Doll' tribute that was serialised in 'My Anime' (マイアニメ).**

Caught an embarrassing mistake made in the Aoyama and Shimuzu three-man talk. I wrote 'a manga gallery' when it's supposed to be Manga Gallery (まんが画廊; Manga Garou; the name of a specific Manga Café). Glad I caught it without committing the same error in another translation. ([**Wikipedia Page**](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%BE%E3%82%93%E3%81%8C%E7%94%BB%E5%BB%8A))  
  
Azuma Hideo's assistant, Oki Yukao (沖 由佳雄**)**, used Manga Garou to scout for individuals to enlist them to draw for the first Lolicon Doujinshi 'Cybele'. Several of the people who worked on Cybele would move on to working in Lemon People and in their own Doujin Circle 'STUDIO BAKI'.

**'Toudai Otaku Lectures' is a transcription compilation of lectures Okada Toshio did years earlier at Tokyo University with many guest speakers regarding Okada's own definition of Otaku. Before this book, Otaku was written as 'おたく', but through this book, Okada popularised its spelling as 'オタク'. Aoyama Masaaki did a lecture on 'Drugs', but unfortunately due to his arrest for cannabis possession, Kodansha (the publisher) wouldn't allow Okada to include his lecture, which may be forever lost to time. There's an interview with Aoyama regarding drugs after his arrest here (**[**Interview**](http://blog.livedoor.jp/yu_hirano/archives/1808002.html)**).  
  
Another familiar name, Shimizu Kazuo (the guy who did the Lolicon Period talk with Aoyama), also did a lecture titled 'Glory and Shadow of Imaginary Warriors' with another speaker about their interests in the occult. For me personally, the lecture I found interesting was the one with Kobayashi Yoshinori (小林よしのり), who does political manga to brainwash young people (he's very popular in Japan). Yoshinori is anti-Otaku, though Okada lumps him in as an Otaku regardless.  
  
The lecture I translated is the 10th one between Okada Toshio and Aoki Mitsue, a female mangaka who married Ogata Katsuhiro, one of the guys Hirukogami Ken mentioned among the four editors responsible for the Lolicon Boom. Ogata was the editor for 'Fusion Product' and 'Pafu', and also worked with Ootsuka Eiji for projects like Manga Burikko. While the topic is 'Yaoi', it's the only lecture that talks about Lolicon specifically, and has several amusing stories. Aoki also has a homepage listed on Gainax's personal website (**[**Aoki Mitsue Profile Timeline**](http://www.gainax.co.jp/hills/aoki/profile/index.html)**).**  
  

**10th Lecture:  
The Endless Ambition of 'Yaoi'**​

  
  
**Originally, there's an image that Otaku is a man's hobby. You would assume that would be the case from the existence of Bishoujo characters. Of course, there are also 'Yaoi-type Bishounen', but Bishoujo own the royal road. Mecha, robots, and Kaiju are also things boys enjoy. Basically, being tone deaf to mecha is taken as granted to be the fate of girls.  
  
There are few girls who enter the male Otaku society, but they do exist. It's a given such girls would be popular, but it's hard for them to be taken seriously. Roughly speaking, Otaku training itself is designed to put girls at a disadvantage. Garage kits are too severe for girls who never built a plastic model before. Getting permission from her parents for an all-night screening party is difficult.  
  
Of course, there are exceptions, but it feels they're no more than mere exceptions.  
  
However, when one goes to Comiket, that common sense is thrown out the window. There are many girls. In a ratio of about seven to three. Apparently, even in the Otaku world, girls are underestimated as being socially vulnerable.  
  
Among them are talents freely and happily pursuing the Otaku path as 'Female Otaku' within the male Otaku society. One such girl is Lady Aoki Mitsue (青木光恵). Even in her manga, she cheerfully declares she likes looking at and touching girls with big boobs. When I asked about this during a conversation, she simply replied 'I also have big boobs'. She replies with a difficult-to-tsukkomi response.  
  
Well, I called that Aoki-san because I wanted to talk to her about the female Otaku way of life, how they live, and their attitude towards life.  
  
  
■Garden of Yaoi**  
  
Okada: "Our next guest is a female Mangaka who loves girls, Aoki Mitsue-sensei. I'll be using the Kansai dialect today so long as I'm talking to Aoki-sensei. Our current theme is 'Female Otaku', but I wasn't certain whether I should've called it 'Women and Otaku' or 'Female Otaku'. I know a lot about male Otaku, but I'm mostly in the dark when it comes to female Otaku."  
  
Aoki: "Girl Otaku is 'Yaoi' (nods and raucous laughter in the venue). That is all. My recently hired female assistant is very knowledgeable in that area. Until now, most of the assistants that came to me were 'girls that publish Lolicon-zines despite being girls'. Yeah, that was a thing; it was a trend."  
  
Okada: "Uwaah... I both kinda wanna be their friend and not be their friend..."  
  
Aoki: "Aren't there people who made their debut in 'Manga Burikko' (漫画ブリッコ) when they were sixteen years old? You know what I'm talking about."  
  
Okada: "More like approached by Ootsuka Eiji (大塚英志).  
  
Aoki: "True (laughs). I was working part-time in an editorial department doing such tasks as organising simple postcards and removing typesetting, and Oo-san held out 5000 yen and said 'This is part-time work. Can you make a receipt?'. And I was wondering 'What kinda part-time work?'. Cause the girls that were doing that were coming as assistants to my place for 10 years. The girls that came to me from a new route said 'All my friends are Yaoi'. Different from the usual fare."  
  
Okada: "When it comes to 'Yaoi', the image in my mind are 'people who publish Doujinshi with male nudity'..."  
  
Aoki: "I believe that would be anyone's image (laughs)."  
  
Okada: "Who's being stripped naked now?"  
  
Aoki: "Right now, it's probably a very wide range."  
  
Okada: "Three years ago, I found a Downtown Yaoi book in a commercially released Tankoubon."  
**Downtown ([Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%80%E3%82%A6%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A6%E3%83%B3_\(%E3%81%8A%E7%AC%91%E3%81%84%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%93\)))**  
  
Aoki: "Downtown, huh? I also drew that (venue bursts into laughter). Though it wasn't Yaoi."  
  
Okada: "What were you drawing? What I saw was Matsucchan tied up with gum tape over his mouth being rolled into a dark room. Then Hama-chan comes in saying something like 'quickly get comfortable, I'm the only one who understands you'."  
  
Aoki: "Hamada × Matsumoto. In the Doujinshi world, there's someone called 'Itou Seiko'-san (イトウセイコ) who paved that road with Downtown, but I've been friends with that person for a long time, so Itou-san introduced me to the existence of Downtown as well. Saying 'Aren't they hilariously funny comedians?'. Though it was long before 'It's 4 O'Clock' (四時ですよーだ), but she took me to see them at that time and I fell in love. That Itou-san started her Doujinshi and drew it there. I believe she was probably the first person in Japan to start doing Downtown books."  
**4時ですよーだ (****[Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E6%99%82%E3%81%A7%E3%81%99%E3%82%88%E3%83%BC%E3%81%A0)****)  
Itou Seiko (**[**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/itopino)**)**  
  
Okada: "So it was Yaoi right from the get-go with Japan's first Downtown Doujinshi?"  
  
Aoki: "Well, the first is... no, it was (laughs). But in the beginning, it wasn't that intense, rather it was a little cute. Before I realised it, Hama-chan was turned into a girl and was put into a test tube in a laboratory. I was thinking oi-oi, but Yaoi drawn by girls has incredible power. I also think men's ero-manga is incredible, but not that kind of incredible. It's changing the setting without permission. For example, I had a friend who made a 'Hikaru GENJI' (光ＧＥＮＪＩ) Doujinshi, but they were requested by the Creator-san 'please write with this and this setting'."  
  
Okada: "It's not an individual book, but rather a collaborative work with the same setting, right?"  
  
Aoki: "Right. So the setting was things like 'Moroboshi-kun is a boy working part-time in a tea house near his high school. He has a baby-face, but he's much older', 'Younger kids go to that high school', and 'Osawa-kun, who's older even among the members, is a high school teacher'. The setting was very detailed. There are many Doujinshi like that."  
  
Okada: "Are those kind of Doujinshi normal drama?"  
  
Aoki: "No, they're 'Yaoi'. There's no normal drama."  
  
Okada: "I'm stereotyping, but when I hear 'Yaoi', I'm imagining a world where a man tells another man to 'show me yer arse!'."  
  
Aoki: "Though you could say 'there's some difference between Yaoi and Homo'."  
  
Okada: "What's the difference?"  
  
Aoki: "There's no poop sticking to the tip in 'Yaoi', whereas the tip's glazed with it in Homo (laughs)."  
  
Okada: "Aah, one student has just gone home in amazement (laughs)."  
  
Aoki: "Pardon my language. I'm fine with dirty jokes. The assistant girl I talked about earlier has other assistant work, and at one of those jobs, everyone's just chatting away about 'Yaoi'. But the Sensei didn't like that kind of chatting and said 'Homo is gross. Cause there's poop on there!'. And then the Yaoi-loving assistant girl glared at the Sensei and retorted 'Yaoi can't poop~!'. There seems to be a point in that area, so if someone asks you what is the difference, that's the answer you should give them."  
  
Okada: "No, no, for real (laughs)? Isn't there plenty of 'Yaoi' without actual sex? Like it's just a slur of words. But even without actual sex, 'Yaoi' is essentially an SM world."  
  
Aoki: "Hmm, when you put it like that, is erotica any different? Even in the stuff men read."  
  
Okada: "You're absolutely right. There's definitely SM in men's ero-manga. **So that's why Japan's Lolicon comics are very popular in America!** When I asked an American, they told me 'you can't express SM in such a straightforward way'. In that country, both men and women welcome SM expression, so if the girl being beaten doesn't look like she's having fun, they consider it gender discrimination. In art, but it's the same even in videos and photos. Even if they're whipped, they have to look at the camera with a smile. There'll be problems if the partner looks like they're in pain when they're hit. When it comes to the truly hardcore, such as 'men bullying women' and 'torturing little girls', it seems you can only buy those through mail order. I'm already amazed from watching American porno videos. The scenes where a man is riding on a woman and the woman is on top are split evenly as if they're measured with a time recorder. It makes me wonder if men will be condemned for discriminating against women if the man stays on top for longer."  
  
Aoki: "Aren't those personal hobbies?"  
  
Okada: "Even personal hobbies are socially restricted. Sooner or later, racial problems will enter the picture and there may be 'pornographic videos that need to show five racial groups' (bursts into laughter). In that country, I wonder if they'll do it like 'Power Rangers'."  
  
Okada: "If I were to mention female Otaku terms aside from Yaoi, there's 'Zuka' for starters. Takarazuka Opera. Then there's Pink House Otaku's Pinky, and Cosplay doesn't feel unique to girls... Ah, there's 'Shota'."  
  
Aoki: "But Shota is different from Yaoi."  
  
Okada: "Ah, there's some people who don't know (laughs). Though the people sitting in the front row of this lecture may understand all these terms (laughs). Shota, you see, is an abbreviation of 'Shotarou Complex', which comes from Shotarou Shounen from 'Tetsujin 28-go' (鉄人28号)."  
  
Aoki: "Short pants are wonderful! (Laughs). Speaking of which, it may be too late, but everyone knows what 'Yaoi' is, right?"  
  
Okada: "Guess I'll explain. In general terms, it's a genre of Homo. 'Yaoi' is the act of turning anime or manga characters into Doujinshi to ignite one's Homo delusions."  
  
Aoki: "It's originally an abbreviation of 'No Peak. No Climax. No Meaning.*', you see. I suppose Homo manga are all like that."  
**※ヤマなし。オチなし。意味なし (YAmanashi. Ochinashi. Iminashi.)**  
  
Okada: "The Yaoi I saw long ago was 'Voltes V' (ボルテスＶ)."  
  
Aoki: "Who × Who, huh? I'm curious."  
  
Okada: "Well, I forgot. Sorry (laughs). But from that period, it was 'No Peak. No Climax. No Meaning'. Heinel was being bullied and Prince Sharkin was being stripped naked."  
  
Aoki: "There was a trend where handsome enemy characters did that."  
  
Okada: "There were two trends: either the strong enemy characters come out strong or they get caught and bullied. I wonder if research papers have been published about this. I would be glad if a complete collection on the historical research of Yaoi books were published."  
  
Aoki: "It'll say on the cover 'this is how the history of Yaoi went!'. It started with 'The Monster Prince' (怪獣王子) and entered 'Heroic Purgatory' (エロイカ)... and so on. That might be good. It's deep, very deep."  
  
  
**■The World is a Daily Life of '×'**  
  
Aoki: "I don't have many 'Yaoi' friends, but when I asked someone who knows about it, like my female assistant from earlier, she told me don't be silly. She also doesn't have a boyfriend, so I'm kinda scared. I, you see, am friends with a Seiji Biblos-type Mangaka-san and I once went to work at that person's place as an assistant for fun, but she had videos running all the time. She would record TV programmes, Anime, and whatever she liked on three 120 minute-long tapes and keep playing them back-to-back. Whenever there's a nice scene, everyone will stop what they're doing and scream '○○-samaa~!', 'his face's sooo cute. Let's rewind and watch it again!'."  
  
Okada: "I have a mental image of someone snacking on potato crisps at home without a boyfriend, but am I far off the mark?"  
  
Aoki: "There's potato crisp grease stains on the manuscript and there's takeout bentou boxes (laughs). I was only there for a full day, but I got to watch the entirety of 'If I See You in My Dreams' (夢で逢えたら), so I learned a lot. BGM was constantly playing there, most of which was by TM Network (ＴＭネットワーク) and as you would expect, she would shout 'his solo voice is sooo good~'. She was playing all sorts of stuff endlessly, it was making me dizzy. I don't get how she could keep doing that for years. As for her. When she went to the place of a Sensei who had a long history as a Mangaka, there was a nearly 40 year-old assistant that's always been working there, managing the life of the workplace. Their life is endless."  
  
Okada: "The editor should extend a helping hand..."  
  
Aoki: "They did, but I'm laughing here, she looks at Editor-san, and went and did Yaoi saying 'Editor ○○-san (male) is on good terms with part-timer △△-kun (male), huh? Suspicious' (venue bursts into laughter). She's always thinking about '×'. 'Which do you think is the 'Uke?' 'Eeh~, △△-kun's definitely the Uke' and so on, getting excited about such trivial stuff, it sounds like she'll say 'then let's make a ○○ book' with people sharing similar interests."  
  
Okada: "Speaking of which, on a television talk show, from such a small detail as 'they're laughing at the same gags despite being seated a far distance', it makes one think 'these two are suspicious'..."  
  
Aoki: "There are many people addicted to entertainment-type 'Yaoi', who'll watch their videos carefully. Once, someone would record 'Yoru no Hit Studio' (夜のヒットスタジオ) and mention 'isn't that the performer of the programme sitting behind the moderator?'. Look at that, '○○-kun and ××-kun are always chatting away happily, huh... Hah, this is it!', and she's gonna make a book about it. Falling for talent is a terrible thing. Because she has to record a lotta videos."  
  
Okada: "Manga is much better, huh? It's easy to check cause the characters are introduced in just that work. So what's going on with Yaoi's source material now? It used to be anime, but it's expanding much further."  
  
Aoki: "Anything and everything."  
  
Okada: "During the Summer Comiket, it was Kaworu-kun (カヲル)."  
  
Aoki: "That's right. As a personal interest, I have some objections to that, though."  
  
Okada: "Also, they don't mix anime characters with real people."  
  
Aoki: "Ah, that's cause they're different races."  
  
Okada: "Yeah, yeah, cause their races are different (laughs). Kaworu-kun × Nan-chan (Unnan's Nanbara [南原 清隆]), and so on..."  
  
Aoki: "I never heard about that (laughs)."  
  
Okada: "For example, if it were similar anime produced by Sunrise, it would be like Sunrise's 4 stars sitting with each other."  
  
Aoki: "They used to do that in Yuuki Masami-san's (ゆうきまさみ) manga. There was a backstage-like thing where Cosmo is getting a perm. I've never seen anything but that kind of stuff in Yuuki-san's manga. There's quite a few talent like that. They pass each other in the studio and the drama starts there. Artists often appearing on the same programme. That's why it's common for different groups and artists to get involved. Cause the real world is interconnected. But in anime and manga, their worlds are separated. So, you need to puncture the world layer."  
  
Okada: "I don't see very much 'Dragon Ball' Yaoi. Though Vegeta seems to be loved as a stubborn boy. Shall we ask everyone in the classroom? Has anyone seen 'Dragon Ball' Yaoi?"  
  
Aoki: "Ah, there's quite a few. Many are raising their hands."  
  
Okada: "Who and who?"  
  
Student: "Kaka × Vege I believe."  
  
Okada: "... Who?"  
  
Student: "Kakarot and Vegeta."  
  
Aoki: "For short. If you shorten it, that means it's used quite often, so they're very... (venue bursts into laughter)."  
  
Okada: "It's nice to have a space where you can say 'Kakarot' (laughs)."  
  
Aoki: "Very happy. After all, girl Otaku are all about 'Yaoi'. Everything's already 'Yaoi'."  
  
Okada: "It feels like they have a Yaoi lens in their eye, so whenever they look at something, it appears as Yaoi."  
  
Aoki: "And it cannot be taken off. It's a natural part of 'em."  
  
Okada: "Even when looking at Hashiryuu (橋本龍太郎) and Ozawa Ichirou* (小沢一郎)..."  
**※These two are crusty old politicians.**  
  
Aoki: "I think so, definitely."  
  
Okada: "In the past, I was forced to do such humiliating play before Kakuei (田中 角栄) (bursts into laughter). Speaking of which, there isn't much Lez-stuff drawn by girls."  
  
Aoki: "No, I think there's a lot. I've seen a lot of that stuff in 'Sailor Moon'."  
  
Okada: "'Sailor Moon' has a lot. But men draw Lez not because they wanna draw Lez. It's more like 'I wanna draw Sailor Moon naked, but I don't wanna draw bastards. What should I do? I know, Lez!'."  
  
Aoki: "In the case of men, I don't get the impression they're doing it cause 'I like Lez!'. But girls really love Yaoi."  
  
Okada: "Indeed, men are different from actual Lez-lovers. Cause aren't they immediately strapping on ridiculous gear around their waists?"  
  
Aoki: "Not really. I had a classmate in high school who loved manga and was a big fan of Takemiya Keiko-sensei (竹宮恵子), and I thought I could talk on the same wave-length with that girl, but we're on totally different wave-lengths. That girl was all 'I hate girls! Female characters are nothing but a nuisance!'."  
  
Okada: "Nuisance."  
  
Aoki: "That girl was drawing manga herself, but the main characters are blond and black haired beautiful foreigners and she would never show any girl characters cause she said she absolutely hated nuisances that get in the way. She says girl characters are nuisances whenever she reads manga and it's annoying; whenever I listen to her, it makes me want to pull away. The idea the popularity of a work drops when a female character appears may ring true. I also read something like 'Misato, you're annoying! You're too attached to Shinji-kun' in Doujinshi for 'Evangelion'. I retorted 'it's not a big deal. It has nothing to do with you' while reading, but it really upsets them. But the person, herself, seems quite serious. That's why they get upset whenever there's a character that gets in the way of the 'Yaoi'. There's many settings where the heroine is the daughter of a doctor or has a relationship with the boy protagonist. That's probably where they got the weird idea the girls are 'interfering'."  
  
Okada: "I'm saying it like this, but it feels like you're describing 'women's work'. Cause when a guy draws a parody of 'Sailor Moon', they don't think 'Tuxedo Kamen, you nuisance!'."  
  
Aoki: "Well, a nuisance is a nuisance, but there's a difference in the way they bear grudges. I'm amazed listening to them. In the workspace of a Shoujo Mangaka-san who draws long serials, because the scene of carnage go on for so long, such topics continue to be discussed even during the last four days. During the last four days, they're all divided as they talk about 'I am ○○-sama and △△-sama!', 'I prefer this!' 'No, I don't approve! Unforgivable!', and so on. Completely different from normal girls talking about boys; anyone who cannot keep up with such topics look like they're so hurt, they're about to cry and whimper 'I wanna go home~. I wanna go ho~ome'."  
  
Okada: "Sounds kinda fun. It feels like a garden of women, doesn't it?"  
  
  
**■Otaku Shoujo's Love**  
  
Okada: "Aoki-san's gotten to know a lot of girl Otaku, right?"  
  
Aoki: "Hmm, I know more boys... I guess. The girls who are generally 'girls that like girls' draw ero-manga and stuff."  
  
Okada: "So there's girls even in such special genres, huh?"  
  
Aoki: "Girls that draw Lolicon ero-manga definitely exist in this world."  
  
Okada: "Many of those manga creators are women, but are the ones who draw those manga 'girls who like girls'?"  
  
Aoki: "I believe so. Also, when I started drawing in those sorts of Lolicon magazines, I guess there were people who were happy to be approached by men. Female Mangaka who draw in Lolicon magazines are people who have boyfriends. The 'he's a dull guy, but he seems to approach me a lot' sort."  
  
Okada: "There's merit in being able to select from a large pool. For example, even if 30 year old dirty Otaku approach you, you have the advantage of choosing the best one from the bunch... Gah, I'm saying terrible things (laughs)."  
  
Aoki: "Comiket marriage (laughs). I believe there's such a pattern. The typical model of a girl who draws Lolicon Manga is they read Lolicon with a side of mecha when they're in middle school. Like the stories written by Akahori Satoru (あかほりさとる), stuff with pictures of a baby-faced girl riding on a mecha. Then they join a Circle that publishes that line of Doujinshi and got friendly with a man five years older than them, and as they go out with each other, she becomes the Circle's mascot. There's many girls with pasts like that."  
  
Okada: "Even in the Circle I once belonged to, the girls were really popular. Because SF and Tokusatsu-related stuff are full of men, a girl that nods in understanding when they talk about 'Tsuburaya Eiji' (円谷 英二) is like digging up a treasure trove."  
  
Aoki: "Like 'there's a girl like that!?' (laughs)."  
  
Okada: "(For some reason, he puts his all into this) Ooh~ 'she's the one! Go—!' (laughs)."  
  
Aoki: "Such girls were popular. Even when quiet, a lot of men approached them."  
  
Okada: "How does a girl like that become an Otaku?"  
  
Aoki: "One of the girls that comes to my place as an assistant said there's a place on top of the department store in Ikebukuro where a notebook is placed. She'll draw an illustration in the notebook and afterwards, someone will write something as a reply, like a kind of exchange. One day she goes in there and goes 'ahh, there's a new notebook' and reaches out her hand, another boy reaches out his hand and their fingers touch, like an old love comedy. From there it's 'go ahead' and 'no, you go ahead', then 'umm, do you like manga or anime?', that sort of encounter."  
  
Okada: "How romantic... It's romantic, but her boyfriend may need to get better taste."  
  
Aoki: "She didn't really go out with that Onii-san, it sounded like they got into a fight and broke up. The reason is because she got angry at him for sending a letter in a Doujin Envelope (laughs)."  
  
Okada: "That's also romantic in a way (laughs)."  
  
  
**■Unforgivable Cosplay**  
  
Okada: "When it comes to girl Otaku, Cosplay has recently been made into a hot topic in the media. Did you do something like that, Aoki-san?"  
  
Aoki: "Hmm, at first I had a desire where I 'wanted to try', but somehow I never got the chance; back in middle school I didn't know Cosplay was really embarrassing. It'll stick to you."  
  
Okada: "Ehh, I did my first Cosplay at twenty, you know?"  
  
Aoki: "There's people like Okada-san, but that can't be helped (laughs). People who do it past twenty, their surroundings are packed with so many people, they'll probably have no choice but to follow that path for the rest of their lives. But Cosplay these days is a little different than it used to be."  
  
Okada: "Now you don't sew them yourself, you buy 'em."  
  
Aoki: "The girls doing Cosplay now have no idea what an Otaku guy's talking about."  
  
Okada: "There's many girls aiming for a chance to make their debut."  
  
Aoki: "I listened in on a conversation at a spa venue, and it seemed like it's a normal conversation between men and women, like 'she really looks good in that Cosplay, huh'."  
  
Okada: "There's something wrong with those people. It's been increasing in the last three years, but there are girls doing girl Cosplay with no knowledge of the source material."  
  
Aoki: "There are, there are (laughs)."  
  
Okada: "So, there's many wearing a white plugsuit who have never seen 'Evangelion', and guys go 'ehh~, you never seen it~!?'. I hate, hate these girls so much, it makes me want to scream 'I'm gonna bury you in Harumi, you bitch!' (bursts into laughter)! The reason they're Cosplaying is because Cosplay is starting to be introduced in regular magazines the last two to three years. So the people thinking it'll be their chance to make their debut are increasing."  
  
Aoki: "Cause those sorts of girls don't buy books or watch videos. Also, moving back to 'Yaoi', there's 'girls who want to be boys' among female Otaku. They don't like real men, but they want to do it with Kojirou (小次郎) and there's the ones who say 'I want to become Kaworu-kun and take a bath with Shinji-kun' (laughs)."  
  
Okada: "They've gotten perverse, huh?"  
  
Aoki: "They're twisted beyond twisted (laughs). For example, no matter how much they like Shinji-kun, they won't go in the direction of wanting a relationship with him as a woman, their desire is 'they want to have a relationship with a male Shinji-kun as a man' to the bitter end. That's why those people badmouth Misato-san."  
  
Aoki: "By the way, I have a video screened at the 'Gainax Festival', but... It's an adult video called 'Come and Break My Virginity' (私の処女を破りにきて). I heard rumours 'there was an AV where the girl moaned and called out a character's name' and when I drew that in a manga, the Director-san himself sent the video to me. There's a comment written by the Director-san, but that Director-san wrote he 'was very scared' because he was a normal person, he wasn't an Otaku or anything. The Actress-san was an amateur, but she was a big fan of 'Yu Yu Hakusho' (幽遊白書), and of course she's a 30 year old virgin that draws Doujinshi. Then she said 'being a virgin is a burden', so she resolved to go into AV cause she thought if it was a professional Actor-san, he would do a good job. However, when it came time for the actual sex scene..."  
  
Okada: "Like they've stumbled into a documentary."  
  
Aoki: "Yeah. They couldn't shoot the AV cause the Actor-san was so turned off he lost his erection. What was the character's name the Actress-san said...?"  
  
Okada: "Tobikage."  
  
Aoki: "That's right, Tobikage! She blurted out 'Tobikage...'. Well, she must've been thinking that if she went that far, she would have to somehow endure it, so the Actress-san thought in her head she was 'Kurama' and made up a story where she was a man in a story involving Tobikage. So she was like 'My*****... My Tobikage...' (bursts into laughter)."  
**※Translator Note: She uses 'ore' (俺), which is generally used by men as a personal pronoun.**  
  
Okada: "And then the Actor-san got confused and read 'Yu Yu Hakusho' in the corner of the room. That really moved me."  
  
Aoki: "The Actor-san said 'I'll try to match her somehow' and made that kind of effort, and tried to liven things up with stuff like 'look-look, Yusuke is watching', but it sounded different from 'My Yusuke' in her head, so she suddenly made a serious face and said 'Yusuke would never talk like that!'."  
  
Okada: "That video was supposed to be shot in one day, but it ended up being a one-night, two-day training camp. At night, the Actor-san read 'Yu Yu Hakusho' and agonised over 'none of this makes sense' (laughs). Then they panned the camera and the Actress was drawing a manuscript for the Summer Comiket. Furthermore, she was clutching a character keyholder with a 'gyu'. Saying 'just you wait, I'm gonna lose my virginity...'. But the end result turned out to be good. They had to put out a video somehow, so it was like a forced documentary, and midway, they put out an explanation for first-time viewers by showing art drawn by an ero-Gekiga creator saying "what is 'Yu Yu Hakusho'...?".  
  
Okada: "I never thought someone would have to explain 'Yu Yu Hakusho' in an adult video (laughs)."  
  
Aoki: "The composition was good. They were laying down illustrations going 'she's become this character and now the actor intends to be this character!' howa~n."  
  
Okada: "Then came the climax, the girl suddenly says 'Tobikage, don't leave me' and the Actor-san replies in a troubled tone 'I have to go now. The gates of the underworld will be closing soon...' backing away from her (burst into laughter). That development was incredible."  
  
Aoki: "That was truly a documentary-like video, when I asked the Director-san, he didn't know the Actress-san was an Otaku at first, so he was scared witless the whole time. With a look of orgasm in her eyes, she says stuff like 'Tobikage, I*****, I...'..."  
**※Translator Note: Again she uses 'ore' (俺), which is generally used by men as a personal pronoun.**  
  
Okada: "Midway, there was a scene where the girl's cheeks were puffed out. The Actor-san thought she was on drugs or something and was trying to employ brainwashing tactics such as 'Otaku should be social!'. But the girl didn't know why she was being beaten, and was gripping a keyholder with a confused face with a 'gyu' (laughs)."  
  
Aoki: "I thought the scene that was very Otaku-ish was the one where a girl would normally say 'Itai' (It hurts) when she's beaten. However, the reaction when a normal person is hit is not 'Ita!', but the line 'Itai'. Otaku often say 'uru-uru', why's that? She said 'Itai' with the tone of that line. When I heard that, I sighed 'aah, it's not good if you say out the onomatopoeia' (laughs). It's no good, don't say it out loud."  
  
Okada: "Many people do it unconsciously. People whose daily conversations lip-sync the ones in anime. Everyone needs to be careful (laughs)."

![Fusion_Product_Lolita_Syndrome_v01_1985_08.jpg](https://varishangout.com/index.php?attachments/fusion_product_lolita_syndrome_v01_1985_08-jpg.12345/ "Fusion_Product_Lolita_Syndrome_v01_1985_08.jpg")

  
  
**Was pleasantly surprised to find out the entire 'Lolita Syndrome' series by Fusion Product have been digitally archived. It's a reprint and catalogue of Doujinshi categorised into different genres all revolving around Lolicon (synonymous with Bishoujo).  
  
You can view these books by searching for '美少女症候群' on Sad Panda. I highly recommend checking these out, since it gives an idea what is considered Lolicon in 1985 and what is considered Lolicon in the early 2000s.  
  
Table of Contents (v1):  
Chapter 1:** Lolicon, Its World  
**Chapter 2:** Macabre Heaven, Shoujo Hell  
**Chapter 3:** Hundred-Thousand Tentacles  
**Chapter 4:** Mecha-Fetishists' Party  
**Chapter 5:** You Got Lana-chan and Lum-chan  
**Chapter 6:** Mecha Anime de Culture  
**Chapter 7:** Sexy SFX Gals  
**Chapter 8:** Shoujo is a Girls' Thing  
**Chapter 9:** Nekomimi, More Nekomimi!  
**Chapter 10:** Bishoujo Fantasy Surpasses Time and Space  
  
**This holds historical value since many of these Doujinshi haven't been digitally archived. While Miyazaki's Clarisse was popular after Cybele during the early Lolicon Boom with a few magazines like 'The Anime' insisting that Lana is the better heroine, Lana and Lum usurped her popularity in the Lolicon Doujinshi world by this point.  
  
For me, chapter 9 is interesting cause it shows an entire chapter of the legendary catgirl Doujinshi series 'Mieko Metamorphosis' (みーこメタモルフォセス) by Takahashi Chiko ([**Digital E-Books of Chiko's Mieko and Super Nyan Nyan**](https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/lists/authors/60066/)). Manga Burikko had a special feature on Nekomimi in their July 1983 issue titled 'Nekomimi Daisuki!', which had an illustration by Kagami Akira and was around when the Moe definition of catgirls were taking off in the Doujin world, and Chiko's doujin was a notable mention in it. Like Noraneko from 'Black Jack' (1975) by Tezuka Osamu is considered to be the first proto-catgirl, but Osamu is more akin to a western furry with his Disney-style art. So Chibi-Neko from 'The Star of Cottonland' (1978) by Ooshima Yumiko (大島 弓子) would be the first proper Shoujo Manga catgirl that's popular with Lolicon followed by Sham from 'Sham Cat' (1979) by Azuma Hideo being the first proper Moe catgirl in a commercial magazine. It's around 1983 when the Doujinshi world was being flooded with Nekomimi, with the 'CAT PEOPLE' Doujinshi being the oldest and hardest to find (there's at least 7 books), and the 'Mieko Metamorphosis' Doujin series being legendary. It's unknown whether Azuma Hideo was influenced by Chibi-Neko or if he was influenced by C'mell from the 'The Ballad of Lost C'Mell' since he's an avid reader of science fiction; the Japanese translation of the short story had C'mell illustrated the following way in 1985.  
  
C'Mell from 'SF Magazine' (SFマガジン) 1985/12:**

**Mieko_Metamorphosis:  

![Mieko_Metamorphosis.jpg](https://varishangout.com/index.php?attachments/mieko_metamorphosis-jpg.12348/ "Mieko_Metamorphosis.jpg")

**  
  
**In any case, I translated the introduction to the first chapter cause it shows how much Lolicon has grown from the Animage issue interview where Yonezawa says 30 out of 700 Doujinshi at Comiket were Lolicon in 1982. By 1985, over a third of all Doujinshi became Lolicon. Rather than people growing bored of it, Lolicon assimilated anything and everything. Okada released a video a couple days ago about Moe being Japan's most powerful weapon, so Uchiyama Aki's ominous words "whatever form it takes in the future, I believe Lolicon will survive" rings true.**  
  

**Chapter One  
"Lolicon" is the Keyword to Becoming Immersed in the 2D-World.**​

  
  
It's been a while since the so-called Lolicon Boom became established among manga and anime fans. Separating from the original meaning of the word, "Lolicon" has combined itself with every genre, and it currently came to present a situation where more than 1/3 of the works exhibited at Comic Market, where thousands of Doujinshi are sold on the spot, are Lolicon (Ero) Doujinshi.  
  
If you were to ask what Lolicon means to manga and anime fans, the only response you would be given is that it's the title to recognise yourself as a being who seeks out 2D images rather than reality. Like how the anime protagonists Minky Momo and Creamy Mami cast spells to transform themselves, Manga Shounen call themselves Lolicon to immerse themselves in the 2D-World (the fact Lolicon does not necessarily mean the Shoujo are sexualised is made clear from the fact that girls who like the cute characters from manga and anime often prefer to call themselves Lolicon and Shotacon as well). Furthermore, the word Lolicon promises freedom from all guilt as the ultimate indulgence——Because it's "Sick". Thus Lolicon equalling Bishoujo Syndrome is one pattern of self-satisfaction, without succumbing to any criticism such as the escalation of Ero-guro or the creation of Doujinshi for monetary gain, rather it swallowed them all and continues to grow bigger and bigger even now.  
  
This book is a work that reprints illustration and manga works published in such Bishoujo Doujinshi into genres divided by their primary motifs. As representative of Lolicon Manga in chapter one, we picked 'Moving Angel' (むうびんえんじょお) from Shiroi Gunpan-san's (白井薫範) individual zine 'ELF'. It's a bright Lolicon Manga, for an immature Shoujo-orientation that's become rarer in recent years, that will satisfy the desire to tease a girl's body.  

**I hope everyone has a Merry Christmas～♪**  
**Please by all means do check out the digital scans of the Fusion Product 'Lolita Syndrome' Doujin anthologies.**  
**Currently, I'm working on translating Shimizu Kazuo's attempt at an analytical map regarding Lolicon Fanzines in 1981 from the same Fusion Product book in the OP.**

<center>※—※—※—※—※—※—※</center>

**Hopefully everyone has had a Happy New Year (and Lunar New Year).  
  
While I finished a translation for Shimizu's article about Lolicon doujinshi, there's still a lot of stuff I need to research, and the possibility I would either need to cannibalise one of Shimizu's other articles on Lolicon doujinshi, or translate that as well. In the meantime, I decided to translate a roundtable talk between many familiar names in this thread regarding the topic of third-rate gekiga back in 1978. By now, you should have a better understanding of what Lolicon means in Japan, so the discussion about how to make third-rate gekiga better appeal to a new demographic of younger readers should be interesting.

Special Feature: Our Manga Part 3  
Have You Seen Third-Rate Gekiga?**​

There is a word called seinen manga. This word scooped up the energy, which was only demonstrated in the works of shounen manga, to release that energy to a much broader audience. Unfortunately, it slowly lost its original potential, and could only establish itself by adjusting to the sensibilities of society. And within the established hierarchy, its first-rate branches (Big, Action, Young Comic) and second-rate branches (Goraku, Shuuman, etc.) have completely sunk and lost their fervour.  
  
Week after week, the only thing delivered to us were nothing more than 500 yen meal sets along a conveyor belt. For those of us whose primary diet is manga, even if it's a meal set, we'll eat it, but it's inevitable we'll grow tired of the same old taste, and the initial freshness of shoujo manga's sugar candy and pudding à la mode will also fade.  
  
In the midst of the mass stagnation of manga, third-rate gekiga has exploded within each individual through the enclosure of ero, far more interesting than the lacklustre entertainment delivered to us every week. I can hear voices saying third-rate is nothing more than ero-manga, but long, long ago, manga used to be third-rate in the world of expression, so I would like to remind you even shoujo manga was a ghetto within the realms of third-rate until a few years ago. Whether you read it or not is up to you, but it's time to discard the prejudice that you don't read it cause it's ero, manga can also depict ero and it's about time we began to acknowledge that is also our manga. (Takamiya Seika [高宮成河])

**Takatori:** "Right when I joined, I was taught by my current sempai these were created for middle-aged geezers or for manual labourers like truck drivers, those sorts. However, when there were no girls at my cram school, I went to the stands to read ero-manga instead of going to cram school, you see. Completely different from them, and it used to be the editors around me were much older, but it somehow dawned on me I'm doing this for young guys who are sexually unemployed."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "In short, it wasn't about whether the contents were good or bad with these editors, you see; their criteria for serialisation was whether this person ever wrote a manuscript before, they selected people for such boring reasons."  
  
**Kamewada:** "Yeah, put simply, they had no policy."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "There were no editorial policies for magazines."  
  
**Kamewada:** "The criteria editors have in the form of whether or not this'll sell is truly vague."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "Simply put, what's been created till now is at the centre of it; for example, since they used blue on the cover and it sold, they think if you use blue, it'll sell..."  
  
**Everyone:** "Hahaha."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "Well, but this is the truth. That's why the cover of 'Kannou Gekiga' is all pink."  
  
**Haduki:** "Like it sells through the editor-in-chief..."  
  
**Takatori:** "That inside front cover is amazing, like Itasaka Gou (板坂剛) on the final page of 'Movie Art' (映画芸術).  
  
**Haduki:** "So now they say the target audience is the younger generation."  
  
**Takamiya:** "As previously stated, we've advanced from creating for factory workers and truck drivers......"  
  
**Takatori:** "Well, there's more and more truck drivers, factory workers, and geezers, but they're changing the focus between 18 to 25 year-olds. Well, simply put, making it in the sort of form it can be an ingredient for masturbation. So, on one hand, a cram school student will read 'Erogenica', you see, and they'll be thinking 'c'mon, third time, c'mon fourth time, ahh, thank god!!'. On the other hand, you'll have the sort that's sexually hungry, unable to catch a woman, you see, and ero-gekiga calms their desires through masturbation, acting as a safety-valve for the system. But I think it'll be a double-edged sword in that they'll go straight to the bang as a way against the system that'll make the old establishment frown. That's the difficult part."  
  
**Kamewada:** "I believe it's going both ways."  
  
**Takatori:** "Well, you see, what I believe had the greatest impact were the middle schoolers that brought them to school. It was about 40 people, you see, and then came the letters with the exact same message from papa and mama."  
  
**Kamewada:** "Right. They came with the exact same message."  
  
**Takatori:** "They have their names written on the back."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "That's cause the Communist Party's pulling the strings behind the scenes."  
  
**Takatori:** "Yeah, it's true!"  
  
**Everyone:** "What, what? Really?"  
  
**Kawamoto:** "Err, it's Ishiko Jun* (石子順), Ishiko Jun."  
**※Ishiko Jun ([Wiki](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9F%B3%E5%AD%90%E9%A0%86)); a movie and manga critic with deep ties to the Japanese Communist Party.**  
  
**Haduki:** "What!? Him!?"  
  
**Takatori:** "Ishiko Jun in Yoyogi?"  
  
**Kawamoto:** "That guy's organising that kinda stuff behind the scenes. You know, he did 'What's Happening to Children's Manga?', using it as a means to banish vulgar manga. He's relentless."  
  
**Takamiya:** "He's really doing that?"  
  
**Kawamoto:** "Since he's been so relentless, anyone that attracts his attention gets a letter. Likely written by Ishiko. It goes around, you see, he writes people a letter and then they finish it off by signing their name."  
  
**Aida:** "Like a chain letter."  
  
**Takamiya:** "If he's doing that, then there must be something like a sample."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "That's cause you cannot make the same sentence without a sample. So, they all went for 'Comic Gang' (コミックギャング).  
  
**Takamiya:** "For 'Gang'!? What's wrong with that?"  
  
**Kawamoto:** "I don't know what was wrong. Probably something that shouldn't be in a gekiga. There doesn't need to be something erotic for there to be something wrong. He doesn't bother with manga that much, so why he's fussing about just gekiga is cause he has a problem with gekiga."  
  
**Takatori:** "However, when you compare 'Shounen Magazine*****' and 'Shounen Champ' to the past, the eroticism has gotten incredible."  
**※Shounen Magazine ([Wiki](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%80%B1%E5%88%8A%E5%B0%91%E5%B9%B4%E3%83%9E%E3%82%AC%E3%82%B8%E3%83%B3))  
  
Kawamoto:** "However, even if it's allowed in 'Shounen Magazine', it's not allowed in gekiga mags. For example, in the magazine 'OUT' published by us (Minori Shobo), there was a line about what would happen to this earth if the words 'Omeko' (Sex) and 'Okome' were mixed up. It was also in 30 or 40pt, huge typesetting, but there was absolutely no problem. If it was a gekiga mag, you would get called out for that."  
  
**Kamewada:** "Even if you say pussy in a literary magazine, it's truly humiliating you can't do that in 'Jitsuwashi' (実話誌)."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "That's why magazines guised as sex at first glance are subject to much harsher restrictions in terms of expression."  
  
**Haduki:** "Being guised as sex makes it already a failure as far as the system itself is concerned."  
  
**Kamewada:** "In regards to that, talking to mangaka, what gets me flying into a rage, you see, though it's a little different recently, Haku's saying he wants to draw shounen manga. What an unpleasant bastard, there's something that makes me doubt his character."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "Do you know Otama Jakushi (小多魔若史)? There's a mangaka like that who used to work as an exclusive assistant for 'Jump'."  
  
**Aida:** "I believe you're referring to Yanagisawa Kimio (柳沢きみお)."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "Yeah, he didn't want to be tied with such a cheap exclusivity fee, so he jumped ship and is now drawing ero-manga. But when I met him, he's the opposite in that he never wants to draw shounen manga ever again. He's making a living on just ero-manga, so as long as it's an ero-manga, he'll draw it for shounen magazines, but he won't draw anything else."  
  
**Kamewada:** "Ahh, that's an insight."  
  
**Takatori:** "Same goes for Dirty Matsumoto (ダーティ松本); he's said even if you give him a million yen, he wouldn't draw in 'Big Comic' (ビッグコミック)."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "I believe Muraso (Shunichi) (村祖俊一) also needs to say that much."  
  
**Kamewada:** "That's why guys saying to calm down and do ero need to get out more."  
  
**Takatori:** "Muraso can defend himself, but he draws in 'Big Comic', and he also draws in 'Shounen Magazine' and 'Erogenica'. So it's not like that. Though he doesn't draw much in 'Big Comic'."  
  
**Aida:** "What about Hachuu Rui (羽中ルイ)?"  
  
**Takatori:** "He's an exclusive for 'Manga Joe' (漫画ジョー)."  
  
**Kamewada:** "He often used to say he 'really wants to draw shounen manga', but there's just something that oozes out of his ero-manga."  
  
**Takatori:** "Hachuu Rui is a poet. He published a poetry collection in high school and is still writing them now. Well, his high school days were interesting. Poetry and violence, he boxed for 3 years, so it's like a fighting elegy. He's done it with Ya-san***** in Shinjuku. So he stuck a Shoujo in those scenes of violence and it drifted in and grown into magazine poetry."  
**※Ya-san: A Yakuza member.  
  
Kamewada:** "That guy's mentally homo. It got late when I was at Lemonsha (檸檬社) and the station was nearby. So when we went home together, he would say 'please stay at my house'. And while we were walking, he would only handle other men with just his right hand like during his boxing days."  
  
**Everyone:** "Gyahahaha."  
  
**Kamewada:** "He's no good."  
  
**Everyone:** "Hahahaha."  
  
**Kamewada:** "It's been a long time since I last walked out in the middle of the night. It's kinda scary."  
  
**Takatori:** "Since he had 'that' sort of violence, I asked him if he wanted to try drawing a boxing manga, but it was still in the afterglow of 'Tomorrow's Joe' (あしたのジョー). So he said he would try it after that afterglow went away."  
  
**Kamewada:** "What was unusual about what he drew in the past was that it was never normal sex. How do I put it? It would be stuff like slicing thighs with a cutter knife and inserting it. Then there's two women doing lez and suddenly a monster jumps out, wearing a fundoshi, and right when you're wondering what's going to happen to the girl, it grasps the girl's genitals and rips it apart. Like throwing a lump of meat at the reader, screaming this is bad."  
  
**Everyone:** "Gyahahaha."  
  
**Takatori:** "They don't draw 'em completely naked."  
  
**Takamiya:** "The ones doing third-rate gekiga are a maladjusted bunch."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "Right, its representative is Shimizu Osamu (清水おさむ)."  
  
**Kamewada:** "When I was in charge of Lemonsha, the opening begins with two colours. There's a man eating an apple, forcibly giving an enema to a girl, and what's depicted is ridiculous beyond ridiculous. He drew the apple brown, you see, so it's like he's eating shit like it's delicious, super delicious. The editor-in-chief saw it and said, "Kamewada-kun, this is bad. This is drawn using brown. Please change it to white. That way, it'll look like piss.".  
  
**Everyone:** "Gyahahahaha."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "There's certainly a kind of degenerate. That's why they can draw all kinds of stories without getting bored."  
  
**Takamiya:** "I think it's more than that. There's quite a few that take advantage of it to keep themselves partly awake."  
  
**Aida:** "Drawing to keep themselves awake."  
  
**Takamiya:** "What's interesting about third-rate gekiga is that there are quite a few interesting ways to take advantage of them. So, it doesn't matter if only a single naked lady appears. As a reader, I want to read interesting manga, but shounen manga is interesting, same goes for shoujo manga and third-rate gekiga, all of these included are our manga. So as for third-rate gekiga, I would like to hear about how you're doing your best in the future with our manga."  
  
**Kamewada:** "For us, if we mess up, we could very well end up like 'Young Comic' (ヤンコミ), you see; strictly warned for those parts. So even if you think about wanting to do this or that, I feel a trend concentrated in the 'Young Comic' reader lobby should come on a regular basis, and with that, instead of going over there, they step over here. By making ero-gekiga into ero-gekiga, we're doing our best after all."  
  
**Everyone:** "........."  
  
**Aida:** "What about Takatori-san?"  
  
**Takatori:** "So, in the end, how do I say this? 'Garo' (ガロ) is the opposite of a magazine for people in their 30s or 40s. So I had Kawasaki Yukio (川崎ゆきお) make Garo more into a Garo-ish gentle series, and by using Muraso of 'Big Comic', my wish is to have a shoujo mangaka draw ero. So if those parts all step into a bar, I feel like we would need neither 'Big Comic' nor 'Shounen Sunday. Is there an artist like that?"  
  
**Aida:** "Isn't there someone already like that?"  
  
**Takatori:** "Well, Takemiya Keiko's (竹宮恵子) amazing. But I'm not sure there's someone drawing shoujo manga with nudity and dicks, that I'm sure."  
**T/N: As a reminder, Takemiya Keiko is the one who did the perfect Lolicon Manga according to the Fusion Product roundtable talk moderator.  
  
Haduki:** "But that wouldn't matter from a man's perspective."  
  
**Takatori:** "No, it's exciting from a man's perspective."  
  
**Takamiya:** "Can you explain to me what the heck you mean?"  
  
**Kamewada:** "I was talking to a friend earlier, but the commercialisation of stuff like pornography is completely different from other forms of expression, you see. We have artistic expression, and if you ask what kind of artistic expression, you have the readers that say it's remarkably fine, and the people examining it are in a way nullifying that. Pornography and stuff like that are standing out more and more. Well, it's certainly having a response. So that's why it's completely different from artistic expression. Whenever I hear about porno also being art, it's lukewarm."  
  
**Takamiya:** "As a new editor."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "From a general perspective, it feels like it won't be difficult. Meaning, as an artist."  
  
**Takamiya:** "So it's the absolute lack of artists?"  
  
**Kamewada:** "There's some. It's been about two years since Hachuu Rui came out."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "That's why they draw ero. There's few people. For example, Noujou Junichi (能條純一) and Shimizu Osamu already understand to some extent what makes it strangely interesting, like they can see into the future. All that's left is for it to be accepted........."  
  
**Kamewada:** "So when it comes to how to do it, there's many coming here with strong opinions, but in short, in third-rate gekiga, in ero-gekiga magazines, something may be done if there's 3 or 4 people working hard at it."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "Also, so long as there are readers, there's a side that says it'll somehow work out. It's easy for artists when there are readers. Like it's impossible to have artists do it when everyone's walking around blind, fumbling about."  
  
**Takatori:** "Err, there's guys hungry for gekiga dropping off, I believe graduating from somewhere like Nagoya, if a boss asks them what sort of foolish stuff they're doing, they would be like 'No, I'm becoming a mangaka'. So, when they go to Tokyo, they somehow eat."  
  
**Kamewada:** "Everyone around our age are building houses. So please write down that third-rate gekiga are also building houses."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "Well, it's because it's a third-rate gekiga that a house is built. The only ones that can handle 300 pages a month though a single person are third-rate gekiga."  
  
**Kamewada:** "Agata Ui (あがた有為) built a house, Shimizu Osamu built a house."  
  
**Takatori:** "Shimizu Osamu has an apartment **(mansion block)**."  
  
**Kamewada:** "Ah, right."  
  
**Takatori:** "So it's still not a time to be that excited; everyone's drawing while poor, but if a newbie can bring it in, they look like they can do just fine. Everyone's drawing at home while going to university, so becoming successful or ghosts. That kind of thing is decreasing."  
  
**Kamewada:** "Well, it's really surprising, but everyone is doing it from extreme poverty."  
  
**Takatori:** "That's cause they're hungry, hungry."  
  
**Kamewada:** "There's quite a few despite being from the same generation as me, same goes for Agata Ui, and Iida(Kouichirou)-kun's (飯田耕一郎) private life is kinda amazing. It makes you wonder why that is, but they're all actually more educated than some crappy university student, which is also surprising. Anyways, Aida-kun is also like that, but Agata Ui was working at a supermarket or something like that and was so tired, he couldn't walk straight at night, like 'aah, am I gonna be buried here?'."  
  
**Takatori:** "In Shimizu Osamu's case, he ran away from home cause he didn't like being the son of a wealthy landlord."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "That would give you the impression he would be an incredibly pure man, but it's interesting he turned out to be such a twisted human."  
  
**Kamewada:** "I wrote about that as well (in a magazine), but we need to stimulate more critique."  
  
**Takatori:** "Why are the ones reading those shoujo manga bastards? Tomohiko Murakami (村上知彦)."  
  
**Everyone:** "Hahahaha."  
  
**Haduki:** "Exactly."  
  
**Takamiya:** "I'm always awake cause of the parts that are so serious."  
  
**Takatori:** "Kawamoto Saburou (川本三郎) is doing gekiga, so I don't know. Kawamoto Saburou worries me. Kawamoto Saburou, Shimizu Akira, those two."  
  
**Takatori:** "Poets are no good."  
  
**Kamewada:** "That's why even the 'Manga Shugi' (漫画主義) folks also feel at their limit; after all, there was a time when those called art youths would critique jazz. There aren't any critiques with the same kind of power of jazz, something you can only talk about as an art youth, so there's still no criticism and method that is suitable for such things as gekiga. Even if you had a conscientious person like Gondou Susumu (権藤晋) (Takano Shinzou [高野慎三]) do it, it was stuff like 'take note of the sincerity placed in such childish lines'."  
  
**Haduki:** "Yeah, it would be like that."  
  
**Kamewada:** "Pretty petty if you ask me; from our perspective, it's not a joke. Being unable to write anything but that kinda thing is, after all..."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "Probably cause he didn't read it. I met Gondou Susumu, you see, and spoke to him, and he didn't know a lick about third-rate gekiga."  
  
**Kamewada:** "Then, of course, there's that. I'm speaking ill of him, but I thought that was stupid. Him neglecting to construct it as a theory and giving up."  
  
**Haduki:** "So far, it seems he's writing just the sensations of the good parts."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "In short, the fact no one speaks about anyone but Ishii Takashi***** (石井隆) I believe is the worst thing. Indeed, it may be Ishii Takashi, but I believe, speaking honestly, he's clearly a special case."  
**※Ishii Takashi ([Wiki](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9F%B3%E4%BA%95%E9%9A%86))  
  
Kamewada:** "Then again, geniuses are amazing. **Meaning there's no point in having 20 copycats breaking through a closed situation when you can have a genius break through. Ero-gekiga changed completely thanks to Ishii Takashi showing up.** Even if you had 20 copies of Sakaki Masaru (榊まさる) show up, it wouldn't have happened. So you have Ishii Takashi, alone, who made it happen; otherwise you would have to wait who knows how many years for a genius. So when it comes to that, we have to hope for the emergence of a genius in the future to secure a place for that, and I'm also being picky, but I believe we could do better in that area. However, the current state of gekiga, and the critique surrounding it, is terrible."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "Well, including critique as a practical problem, the beings known as readers aren't established. It's a situation where you don't know if they're there or not."  
  
**Kamewada:** "So long as we keep coming to places like this, we'll never meet our readers."  
  
**Everyone:** "Gyahahaha."  
  
**Takatori:** "Well, err, if you go on a date over the phone, a lot of people will come."  
  
**Kamewada:** "They won't come if it doesn't have that kind of thing. For example, even 'Daikairaku' sends the model's panties as a present. So a lot of 'em are coming. There's absolutely no letters to the editors besides that, so for example, you often have a reader's column, right? Those are a total sham."  
  
**Takatori:** "Well, ours are all genuine; in our popularity votes, at least 20 maniacs come out of the woodwork every month. So every time we give out adult toy presents, I'm surprised by the lechers who aren't maniacs."  
  
**Everyone:** "Wahaha."  
  
**Takatori:** "They're already completely..."  
  
**Kawamoto:** "But well, with just 'Erogenica' as the exception, the rest are mostly phonies. You can tell by looking at their names."  
  
**Kamewada:** "That's why when I was at 'Daikairaku', I was always diligently writing letters."  
  
**Everyone:** "Hoho—"  
  
**Kamewada:** "And when we were close to our deadline, I would say 'you write half'."  
  
**Aida:** "In that sense, you could say 'Erogenica' has created an environment for the reader to some extent."  
  
**Takatori:** "We're creating it. Mostly because I'm hoping to meet my readers."  
  
**Aida:** "The so-called 'Young Comic' reader's lobby..."  
  
**Takatori:** "Well, there aren't any morons with big heads like that."  
  
**Kamewada:** "Well, as for that, when it comes to 'Young Comic', the first thing I do when I buy them is read Ishii Takashi's 'Angel's Guts' (天使のはらわた) and 'Dokuro' (読ロ). Every time I read 'Dokuro' I would get harassed, so it turned into an unpleasant experience."  
  
**Takatori:** "A while back, a reader said 'Manga Magazine' and 'Erogenica' were interesting and he wrote for a bit, and here I was surprised thinking this is not good."  
  
**Kamewada:** "Speaking of which, when Shimizu Osamu came to our company for two to three days, that guy was also going ahahaha, saying 'You wrote about Alice in Erogenica'..."  
  
**Everyone:** "Wahahaha."  
  
**Takamiya:** "I'm thinking of creating something new, but there's always a situation where the lowbrows will come again and ruin everything, so it's hard getting around that..."  
  
**Kamewada:** "True. Indeed, meeting specific readers would have a great impact, so it all boils down to this; I don't care if I'm wrong, so other than having a policy to set up a reader's column, I feel there's nothing else we can rely on. Unless you do a proper analysis of the data, there's many parts that'll fall out and get lost. That's why in the end, I feel this is the only way when it comes to this."  
  
**■Third-Rate Gekiga Creator Focus In  
  
By Ijuuin Ranmaru (伊集院乱丸)  
  
  
Dirty Matsumoto (ダーティ松本):**  
Published the Tankoubon 'Meat Slave Doll' (内の奴隷人形) and 'Crazy Nuisance Doll' (狂った微惑人形) from Kubo Shoten (久保書店), mainly in 'Hunter' (ハンター) and 'Pleasure No.' (悦楽号). In addition to his pen name based on 'Dirty Harry', he has earned himself the names 'Gekiga Hentai Devil', 'Gekiga Butcher' and 'Gekiga Sex-Killer'. True to those names, his men violently rape with pistols and penises and his women are thoroughly abused as playground equipment for their pleasure. In particular, the brutality of his anal torture and sandwich torture are the quintessence of his world of super violence.  
  
**Shimizu Osamu (清水おさむ):**  
Currently active in 'Alice' (アリス), Erogenica (エロジェニカ), and 'Comanche' (コマンチ). In his stories where the protagonist is a lady with long hair and sharp eyes with fluttering eyelashes, he's a creator who cannot help but draw scenes of extreme tragedy in which the neck, torso, and internal organs explode at least once in every work. He also goes crazy with the cruel and love-juice afterglow scenes depicted in his double-page spreads. In addition, the heroine's sassy violence as she approaches obscenity and ruin is also incredible.  
  
**Muraso Shunichi (村祖俊一):**  
In addition to 'Erogenica' and 'Pleasure Seven' (快楽セブン), with the pen name <Narukami Shun> (鳴神俊), he also draws in 'Big Comic' and 'Shounen Magazine'. Without the "filthiness" particular to ero-gekiga, his women being raped and his women being tortured during SM are always praised for their sublime beauty. In particular, the height of his pride, 'Harlot Marie' (娼婦マリー) from 'Erogenica', is so cruel in which the female student who despises herself becomes a drug addict and sells her body. Saying, "Know how I feel. Just try taking customers with yer pu**y...".  
  
**Agata Ui (あがた有為):**  
The best-selling ero-gekiga drawing in various places like 'Daikairaku', 'Comanche', 'Adams' (アダムズ), 'Olympia' (オリンピア), and 'Alice' (アリス). His females all have glamorous bodies whether they be schoolgirls, housewives, or OL. His stories include rape, SM, and Lez, but his tattoos are unique and his stories where they're raped by the elderly are rare even among ero-gekiga. Perhaps the fact they're so willing to open their bodies without resistance when they're being raped by men is the reason his works are so appealing.  
  
**Tsuchiya Shingo (土屋慎吾):**  
With themes where schoolgirls and young wives with plump bodies gradually go into heat as they're bullied by middle-aged geezers, he makes light of them as they're teased and forced into embarrassing poses. Furthermore, his depiction of a woman's shame and agony is excellent, especially their half-opened lips and tightly-closed eyes, arousing the reader's desire with his style of ero-gekiga. Currently active in the Nyotai Series of 'Daikairaku' and 'Alice'.  
  
**Genkai Tsutomu (玄海つとむ):**  
Drawing in places such as 'Daikairaku' and 'Alice'. The voltage of his depictions are quite good, but more than that, his stories and names***** (ネーム) are solid. His favourite theme is stepmother bullying, where a daughter becomes equal as a woman, and she and her adoptive mother engage in foul-mouthed swearing and resentment, like an unforgivable rivalry between women, such as seducing men and raping each other. Also, his women who are black around the eyes are incredibly strong and lewd, a perfect fit for his theme.  
**※Name(Manga Term) ([Wiki](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8D%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0_\(%E6%BC%AB%E7%94%BB\))). A **blueprint for manga, panelled and with dialogues.**  
  
Hachuu Rui (羽中ルイ):**  
A best-seller that draws in many magazines, such as 'Joes', 'Comanche', 'Alice', and 'Daikairaku'. He specialises in works where schoolgirls are the protagonists. His stories about schoolgirls, drawn with clean lines, who are afraid of sex, but gradually grow to want it. The coolness of their reactions gives them a unique lyricism, which is why he is being called a sensual poet. He's especially good at masturbation and lesbian scenes, and with the transparency of the girl's upturned eyes, they make you feel the beauty in his obscene eroticism.  
  
**Nakajima Fumio (中島史雄):**  
Although centred in 'Erogenica', he not only has experience in 'Skat' (スカット) and 'Olympia', he also has experience as an assistant of Masaki Mori (真崎守) at one time in 'COM'. His '紫瞬記' series that deals in Shoujo stuff known as lemon sex, particularly a lesbian one between the Bishoujo Maya and her female teacher, stands out because it doesn't have the sloppy scenes other lesbian stuff do. **By depicting the twisted faces of Shoujo in a strangely glamorous way, he provokes the lust of Lolita Complex readers.  
  
Iida Kouichirou (飯田耕一郎):**  
Became a mangaka after working as an editor at 'COM'. In addition to working in such magazines as 'Alice', 'Daikairaku', and 'Sensual Age' (官能時代), he draws gags under the pen name of 'Kouichirou' (耕一郎). His stories, mainly centred on the monoloques of girls, have a peculiarly dull mood, in the sense they're akin to a shoujo manga. He's a playful and addicting creator, rather than a creator who draws the reader in with powerful depictions. At any rate, his Shoujo, drawn with a tasteful and exquisite touch, are quite cute.  
  
**Miyanishi Keizou (宮西計三):**  
Active in 'Alice', 'Adams', 'Dokkiri No.' (ドッキリ号), and 'Special Young Comic' (増刊ヤングコミック). There are many 2-colour pages at the ends of his books with bold compositions and a sophisticated, grotesque art style in the likeness of French dramas, making his phantasmic and beautiful fantasies marvellous. Moreover, his sense at depicting the eyes, tongue, sweat, and wrinkles of clothing is worth a glance. Homo, transvestism, doll love, and so on. His child pornographic works with abnormal themes can be seen in 'Dreamer Pippyu' (夢想家ピッピュ).

This is Kawamoto Kouji's website and it has 22 chapters plus four extra autobiographies of information; far too much for someone like me to translate, but it goes into detail about everything involved in Third-rate Gekiga Boom, vending machine magazines, Labyrinth (the group Yonezawa is part of) and so on that has led to the Lolicon Manga Boom. In addition to further details about the contents of the above Playguide Journal article. The funniest part is that Ishiko Jun is also mentioned in the opening summary of the 3rd autobiography. It's been 30 years and his supposed trouble-making antics left that deep of an impression on Kawamoto Kouji. He has a large list of books in relation to manga critique, like this is the cover of the one mentioned in the above roundtable discussion.**

**"Series for Parents and Teachers #3: 'What's Happening to Children's Manga?' (子どものマンガをどうする) Papa, Mama, Sensei, Think Seriously!" by Ishiko Jun (**石子順).**  
  
**Cannot find any info for Ishiko Jun in English, and his Wikipedia page is rather sparse, but I'm curious how much of an effect he had on manga regulation and the rise of Otaku Bashing. Found a blog that shares some information about this book and Ishiko Jun, though with how he's presented, I cannot think of any western equivalents of him since most westerners I know that criticise manga for being too vulgar are far more ignorant than Jun is about the industry (****[****Blog****](https://goito-mineral.hatenadiary.org/entry/20050512/p1)****).****
