# No Fap

> 1 - Nofap's broscience has partially converged on many truths known to eternal tradition, great precedence in power gains of sexual meditation. However, it misses two key aspects the ancients knew: semen retention, and SEX!

> 2 - It is only abstinence of ejaculation, and abstinence of lust, which will lead you towards immortality. Your sexual energy must either be cultivated and internalized, or entirely redirected entirely away in a true celibacy. Simple restraint from acting on lust is not enough.

> 3 - Cum is one of Daoist's 3 essential life-energies to be treasured, preserved and cultivated; they believed you only have so many ejaculations in your life before you die. Excessive cooming was considered to result in premature aging and fatigue. Sound familiar?

> 4 - The immediate physical gains of nofap derive from testosterone. The T gains of no fap (and subsequent lift gains) are well known to the experimental bodybuilder sphere. The schedule peaks at Day 7 at about 1.5-2X gains. Do note: this sets a new baseline and stacks indefinitely
