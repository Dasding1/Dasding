# The Quest for Miku Hoshino

Greetings. I have been studying the work of TopDrunkee on the old forum. Some of you may know him as Leviathan or Jack.  
  
His current absence is unfortunate but I've decided to try and solve a mystery that he brought to light fifteen years ago.  
  
The tale of an elusive JAV actress named Miku Hoshino, who has, through the years, gone by many names.

![[mikuhoshinososexy03.gif]]

You might recognize her as the Image Girl for this subforum. I am told that this forum is ran by fans of TopDrunkee, as opposed to the gay website we are conjoined with like a retarded siamese twin.  
  
According to TopDrunkee's research, these are: Miku/Emiri/Emily/Misora Hoshino (Japanese alias), Agnes Inoue (United States of America alias), Mi Kyung Kim (Korean alias). Doing my own research, I managed to find two more aliases, Hoshina Rei and Hoshino Mihong, perhaps she used them in China?

![[Pasted image 20250421171841.png]]

Her ethnicity is a mix of Brazilian, French(Black), Japanese and Korean. TopDrunkee managed to friend request her on Facebook back in the day but, from what I can tell, her Yakuza contacts warned her to stay away from him.  
  
She only starred in JAV for two years. She tried to hide her identity back in the day and through the course of time a lot more information has been lost to digital rot. I have been trying to find as much as I can. According to TopDrunkee's research, there are 45 videos in total.  
  
I think as a community we can come together and uncover the remaining Miku Hoshino videos and maybe send them to the Man himself.  
  
This is what I managed to find. I have been warned by Rake that we are not allowed to host pornography directly on the forum so please just use hotlinking.

### Drunkee's reply

> The tale of an elusive JAV actress named Miku Hoshino, who has, through the years, gone by many names.  You might recognize her as the Image Girl for this subforum. I am told that this forum is ran by fans of TopDrunkee, as opposed to the gay website we are conjoined with like a retarded siamese twin.

LOL that's hilarious. I personally just consider them as the same site. I do have a blog section that I will eventually turn into its own mini site. I'm just using it to host my own gaem projects and talk about random esoteric mysticism shit, with the works of David Lynch being one of the subjects of interest.

> through the course of time a lot more information has been lost to digital rot. I have been trying to find as much as I can.

That's actually common. Even someone as famous as Ran Asakawa is really hard to find info on these days. I immediatly thought of her when I saw all of these stupid Lily Philips vids on my youtube feed talking shit about her because she fucked over 100 or 1000 guys in one night. Even that dumb motherfucker Tim Pool labeled her as a degenerate aftereffect of Liberalism, and I'm like bruh isn't this just capitalism? (She's not even a Lefty, she's just a typical apolitical sloot. When I listen to her speak, she just comes across like a typical munny hungry clout chasing capitalist.) Did Dim Fool mean NeoLiberalism? I could agree with that, but meh. It's just the Grift Right doing what they always do, talking a lot of shit and they never know what the fuck they're saying.  
  
I was subbed to Lily's channel (she made some pretty hot vids. Not as hot as Linsey Donovan, but still pretty hot.) before she got banned from yootube and she only got banned because Cuckservatives suddenly started (nonstop) crying about her being the downfall of soyciety. Real life basically is the first season of "The Boys", it really is Corpos trying to simultaneously keep the Christcucks & the SJW Woke Consoomerists happy since they're the two largest American consumer groups. I thought of Ran Asakawa because she fucked over 100s of dudes in one night way back in the 2000s but you never saw any corny ass pearl clutching right wingers crying about it.  
  
That's what I really hate about Western society, both their Left & Right are annoying moralfags. I vastly prefer the Amoral culture of Japan, where they just treat sexual proclivities as meh, that's life. It's just a bodily function similar to farting. Whereas in the West, they literally act as if God is watching you fuck or some shit. Or in the Leftist case, they view the act of fucking a woman, as misogynism. I dunno man. Fuck them all. As I iterate, I ain't no centrist. (that's the group I hate the most, like my disdain towards Dim Fool.) I'm someone who simultaneously has far right & far left views, and I just see two factions of dysfunctional retards crying over people fucking, as if that weren't just life.  

> Her ethnicity is a mix of Brazilian, French(Black), Japanese and Korean. TopDrunkee managed to friend request her on Facebook back in the day but, from what I can tell, her Yakuza contacts warned her to stay away from him.

I have never done that. I don't add people first. People add me. Even everyone from this forum who has me listed as their friend, has added me first. That includes the guy who owns this site.  

It also shows a vast ignorance on how Asian societies operate. In Asian cultures, we don't talk to whomever we want. You have to be invited by someone within the group. This is how it's always been done in both Japan & Korea.  

Ironically, I did have plenty of contacts who knew her and I even went out with a woman who was a part of her social circle. Not that I knew that at the time. That was just back when I was in my Christuck phase, and the gook woman happened to be one of those protestant Christians. (Which seems to be the 2nd largest religious denomination in Korea, or 1st if you don't count Atheist as a category.)  
  
Yakuza don't even know who Miku is. I don't think that's feigning ignorance since there was a time when Yaks would show me new acts or products of new jap bitches that came down the assembly line that they assume that I'd be interested in. (I was mostly shown big titty bitches who look vaguely White. Some of them had big asses lol.)  
  
From what I observed, I think she's just Korean French who speaks fluent Japanese & broken Korean-accented English, despite looking like an English speaker. She has minute ties to Japan, and def did not have ties to Yakuza, other than being a product. She has ties to a Korean social circle from the NYC, many of whom were responsible for the Korean Hiphop of the 1990s & early 2000s. (I'm not naming names, because these were all pretty big name guys from their era. Even the Mexican from that group cut off all ties with me.) That's the group that I got kicked out from, and I don't blame it because I was trying to get her to join the Japs.

While I was attracted to her at the time, I really just wanted her to join the outsiders.  
Whenever I see a woman who looks like a perfect fit, I try to introduce them to that world.  
I have no interest in Hana Kimura,

![[Hana-Dancing.gif]]

but I believed that she would've had a much better life as an outsider rather than trying to conform with the mainstream, who completely rejected her. A lot of my predictions in the Hana thread came true, Giulia really did end up getting recruited in the USA, and she was currently the diva champ in the WWE developmental territory. It's just obvious that Giu was the next in line after Hana killed herself with a bag of farts.  
  
I'm a typical dude, I really don't give a fuck about a woman when they're over 30 years old. She has to be in her 40s by now.  
I have 30 gb worth of vids & have nearly all of the vids in this thread. Her 1st year vids are pretty good. Anyone know where I could upload that shit? I have it stored in some usb somewhere. It's pretty good during its era, but in the modern era we have all of these e-girl zoomers and younger millennials who out rank her imo.  
  
I made some galleries of her. Not sure if you can see it, but download that ish and save it, because I'm prob going to delete it to make more space.

The shower fuck and the third act were pretty good. Very dirty.  
I give it about a 3 out of 5. She's basically a submissive house wife in this one, which funny as fuck to me, because  

she doesn't even look Japanese. (Doesn't look Korean either.)

If you only watch one, this is prob the one to see. In any other country, this girl would've been a model, but in Japan  
she's just a used up porn whore, and that's hot lol.  
She looks fucking pretty in every scene. (and has a really huge ass with a thin frame.)

Only has like one scene. It was very dirty and gutter trash, but was it worth it for that one scene?  
I don't know. It wasn't bad, but I don't even think that she looked that good in it either.  
I don't recall the scene being bad though, it just wasn't worth the time looking for it.

I only have short clips of this, but it didn't seem to be anything worth mentioning.  
Despite the edgy title, it just looks like normal consensual sex. Although imo Miku looks like a chick who could rape the shit out of most faggy jap boys.

I can't stand anal, but I do make an exception for this scene because it was really hot.

She's only in one scene, but the scary yakuza dude fucks the shit out of her. It's pretty hot just for that reason alone. I have that scene, but not the rest of the video. Which doesn't matter because she's clothed in the rest of the vid.  

The rest of the vids listed in this thread are just compilations of old footage. I actually have 5 more vids that aren't listed in this thread. They were pretty good, if you're into complete gutter trash garbage where a high classed looking woman is fucked around like garbage lol.  
  
The only vid that I'm missing is the one with a code that starts with gey. I'm also missing the carribean one that's completely uncensored, but honestly I don't fucking care.  

We live in an era where you can just generate AI bitches that look better.

We can't post porn? Well I'll post one pic. She ain't even real. It's just some David Lynchian inspired AI. I got banned from that place, because I kept generating weird ass Lynchian shit lol.

I think Karen Uehara was way hotter than Miku, but Karen already is part of 'The Culture' or what I call the outsiders. (It has nothing to do with the Buraku, but it can include them, since they're outsiders too.)

She speaks fluent English. Last I recall, I think most of her social media accounts have been banned.  She's from the Middle East, so obviously she's going to get the ban hammer since her politics are against the Chosenites.

> motziee Search her up lol she is gorgeous

I finally fucking replied mothafucka. Remember dat bitch?

> I can see why TopDrunkee hates this website now and yes nobody gives a shit about your dumb fucking autheur theory reddit videogames about homer simpson eating ass.

There's a specific reason why I hate gamers. Speaking as someone who came from the Music industry side of things, I often find that you can't talk about anything with gamers, because gamers love to pointlessly argue about semantics from what I presume, is an attempt at showcasing their intellectual superiority.  
  
Another behavior that I hate about gamers is that they're the dumbest, most passive consumer-base I've ever seen who also love to constantly appeal to authority. Said authority constantly fucks them in the ass like Nintendo does to their loyal 40 year old child fanbase who happily eat up the $99.99 game. Motherfucking the new Daemon X Machina is listed at $99.99 who the fuck is buying that for that price?  
  
Another thing I hate about gamers, you're not even allowed to be a normal Conservative.  
Gamers just lump you in with their imagined right wing terrorist groups when it's normal for Asians to be Conservative. Most Japs are, despite how their party is called the "Liberal Democrats" (Japan is just so traditionalist hierarchal & collectivist hyper-authoritarian, that simply being a Libertarian is enough to get you labeled as a Lefty or Progressive, within Japan.) 

You can't even talk shit about the World Economic Forum when amongst gamers, because they treat you like you're insane. (Since gamers don't know how to read.)  The WHO actually tells you exactly what they've been planning on their fucking website, for all to see. 

I have noticed that young zoomer & core millennial people lack basic reading comprehension so they can't actually understand anything unless some faggot youtuber tells them what to think, but the irony is that the youtuber is just as illiterate as they are, so it's a circle jerk of retards, quoting other retards.  
  
Why do gamers always call me a Qtard or Qanon or whatever? I don't get that treatment from any other group but gamers. 

What does Qanon even mean anyway? I know what Qanon is, and I'm prob one of the only people who understand what Qanon is (It's just an Airforce declassification category. It has nothing to do with a movement, and in the modern era it's most likely a Space Force designation.), but the way that word is used by gamers, doesn't describe the Qanon movement at all.  
  
The modern day Qanon conspiracy, are an alleged splinter group from within the American military who have allegedly formed a coalition against Satanic cults & Influences.  That's why I get annoyed when gamers (And it's always motherfucking gamers! They're the dumbest motherfuckers of all.) constantly label me as a Qanon kook.  

I say alleged splinter group, because Trump is just replacing you with Pajeets to appease Silicon Valley. He gets rid of illegals who did the jobs that nobody sane wants but then he's going to import Jeets who do the jobs that everyone wants, such as making video games. It's not Make Amurrica Great Again, it's Make Elon King, oh and give Israel whatever they want. That too. I prefer Zionists over Open Society though, but it's really a case of which shit sandwich do you prefer?  
  
When you read what I actually say, I don't really have a negative opinion of Satanists, and I also don't believe that they're running Satanic cabals that govern the world. To me, they just exist and don't really affect anything on a world wide scale. 

Much of what gets labeled as Satanic, is really just Catholic (The Serpent imagery is Catholic symbolism that's erroneously attributed to Satanists.) or various other branches of Christianity that differ from the American majority which is Southern Baptist, a type of Protestant. American culture as a whole is Calvinist, including the Woke SJWS.  

Even the Free Masons are just a bunch of fucking goofy Christards. Although I admit that they're slightly smarter than the avg Christian, since the type of Christian that most of them identify as a type of Gnostic. Which is the only branch of Christian that connects back to those Red Haired Giants ( Tuatha De Danann or Hyperborean, I'm not sure which.) who have spread knowledge throughout the ancient world.  
  
Yet for some reason, all of these different branches of Christian, gets labeled as Satanist, lol.  Satanists in reality are just secular progressive or libertarian types. The modern strain of Satanism is progressive & leftist, but historically they were libertarian and right leaning.  
  
This girl is a right leaning Satanist. (Which is ironic I know, since most self proclaimed Right wingers would reject her just for being Satanist. Thulian is connected to the Thule Society though, and I'll let you figure out the rest for yourself.)

In the music scene, rarely anyone treats you like you're crazy if you talk about weird esoteric shit, or the illuminati, freemasons, satanists etc. because that's just known as a common everyday reality within the industry.  It just comes with the territory of the music biz.  You bring this shit up in the gaming scene though?  They call you Qanon, or a qtard or conspiracy theorist.  

They act as if they're smarter than you when it's obvious that none of these losers read, and the entirety of their knowledge base are opinions (not even facts, it's just opinions) that they learned from upvoted plebbit users, 4chan memes, tiktok vids & tv shows.  
Everything they think they know, is just 2nd or 3rd hand information but all of that information that they've gathered is retarded and is parroted by other retarded motherfuckers, until it becomes one large clusterfuck of fucking retards all repeating the same fucking bullshit.  
  
Unlike video games, there's plenty of music artists who speak about those specific subjects but the one I name drop the most is Tupac, because it's humorous to me how so few are aware that most of his subject matter would be labeled as 'qanon' or conspiracy if he weren't a famous left wing black dude. 

Gaming doesn't really have any true mavericks or independent thinkers (Gamers are so dumb that they think 'independent thinker' is a dog whistle for White supremacy or right wing.), the few who existed got blacklisted from the entire industry like Itagaki.  

Every hobby has a faction of busybody dumbasses sure, but speaking specifically about music or even film, there's actually a lot of people within those hobbies who directly partake in secret societies who can corroborate what you say, if they're allowed to.  
Not that there's anything special about secret societies. (From what I've observed, it's really just an indirect potential talent pool of resources perused by Nationalist groups such as the Zionists & similar special interest factions. No this is not their officially stated purpose. Most of these secret societies didn't even exist though until after 'Chosen ones' got exiled from Ancient Rome. Read in between the lines, it seems to have been formed as an information network of sorts that unaffiliated groups recruit from.)

Most of those secret society conspiracies are just paranoid bullshit created by Christians who hate anyone who's not them. Which is ironic because a lot of those groups that they hate, are also Christians. (Most so-called "Satanists" are just Catholics.) They're just not Southern Baptist, which is the real origin of the hate.  
  
  
Another thing I hate about gamers, the right wing portion of gamers are constantly DOOOMING AND GLOOOMING 24/7  
like this guy.  
[https://www.youtube.com/@PtolemySL](https://www.youtube.com/@PtolemySL)

Pick any vid, it's just constant whining. I don't disagree with him, I just think that much of his complaints are surface level. Like most Right Wing retards, he honestly thought that the Kanye West Nick Fuentes political party was anything more than just a joke. You could even ask Rake this, but a month or two before the Nick Kanye party fell apart, I was talking shit to him about how it was the dumbest political party that I ever seen, and how it won't last long. 

Right wing gamers really don't understand that it's really just gaming that's populated with retards. The world still seems somewhat normal once you leave the gaming plantation behind. Although I understand why you wouldn't want to abandon gaming, because it just allows these tourist fucks to completely take over, but I just view it as a losing battle that can't be won. These tourist nerds want gaming more than I do, so just let them have it. 

I think your life would be much more fruitful if you came from a different sub culture and then make games that reflect your culture. In the Music biz, they actually treat me like I'm human and it's fairly common to find people within the music hobby and biz who are also aware of esoterica and ancient history. Martial Arts/ Fighting? They treat me like a fellow bro. (Not Wrestling though, that's the one hobby that's even gayer, faker and more retarded than gaming.)

In the occult & esoteric discussion crews (real ones, not those retards you see on reddit or 4chan.), they call me a scholar. I'm never shown that amount of respect within the gaming community. I just get constantly dissed by gamers, but that's honestly just normal. That's the way gamers are, they're spiteful. Just look at the way they treat Clayton Chapman AKA SeishuKessen. He's a guy who looks like a male model but can outplay most fighting gamers, since gamers are naturally hateful people they get back at him by constantly lying about him and calling him a schizo. (How is he a schizo when he's talking about shit that's actually happening to him, and you can clearly see it happen to him? That's the way gamers are, they just words. I don't even think they know what the words mean.) 

Even MaxMillianDood lies about him. (Maxmillian is a hardcore SJW, which is hilarious to me because everyone assumes that he's a dudebro.)  
  
Every single hobby has been taken over somewhat by Corpos and their wokie religion but gaming is really the only one I've seen that doesn't have any normal people at all. The gamers are fucking losers. The game devs are fucking losers who wish they were in Hollywood, the game journalists are fucking losers who wish they were on CNN or MSNBC, the entirety of gaming is nothing but losers because they kicked out every single person who was normal. Gaming is actually the only hobby I take part in that completely cancelled me but everything they cancelled me for is completely fake.None of it is true.

I honestly thought that I was going to get Metoo'd since I was one of those guys who would just walk up to a hot woman and lick her face (back in the day as late as early 2014, you used to actually be able to show sexual affection towards women, unlike now where we're forced to act as asexual & show no interest, otherwise you risk an online jealous hate mob ruining your life.) and they'd lick you back, but I never got cancelled from them and I thought that was the most likely groups to have a beef with me. (Hey if it even happened to Johnny Depp, and Amber Heard is fine as fuck.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3rD4ylD53V0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

That could've happened to any of us, because few straight men could resist her back when she looked like that.

Depp won the trial but if you look him up online, you see nothing but angry women and manginas talking shit about him daily and calling him a loser & this matters because he can't get hired for roles anymore.) The only drama that came my way was from the gamers, but all they ever did is lie about me, and none of these people have ever expressed their beefs with me. They all just talk shit behind my back like a bunch of fucking pussies.  
It did affect some cliques I established within the music scene but they eventually figured out that it was all just stupid bullshit made up by terminally online gamer nerds. Most of my groups no longer exist, but I do find it amusing that I'm usually the one guy that most of my old crews have kept in contact with even though most of them no longer consider each other as friends.

> Are you from the OG forum? Can you clarify what the backstory for this is?  
> I mean both the porn star (lol!) and the forum, I joined here because I wanted some place to discuss grasshopper games that isn't infested with SJWs and faggots but it seems all the users here hates the games, never talks about them, all the users who talked about the games were banned? and that nobody who runs the website is active on the forum. I don't know who to ask if you are even still here because all I come across are bots posting steam deals
> I think I can explain it. I've been in pretty much every Suda51 community and discord and they are all really scared of this forum to the point of insanity, in some cases they talk about it all the time like they are obsessed, but when I joined I realized it was pretty dead and stuff. Allegedly when the owner of the website PH51 relaunched it as a Suda51 fansite the members of the forum were really mad at him because they hate Suda and his games. Hopefully with the remaster of Shadows of the Damned it'll get more users who love the games of grasshopper and want to discuss them.

I created this place (not this specific board, but the idea of it.), and I don't even know what the fuck is going on here. I fucking hate modern internet precisely because of what that guy you quoted said, it's filled with annoying moral-faggots & sjws. I only bother to show up now after seeing what crazy shit goes on if I don't show up every once on the eve of a red moon. It's yet another example that proves to me just how crazy and retarded gamers are. I can't even leave a gaming site without some stupid gamer shit happening. Honestly I just assumed that a random Satanist bitch would've took over since satanist broads took over most of my other communities that I made back in the 90s & 2000s. I just think the satanists are funny though, they're basically like modern day hippies, but look like prono goth sluts. The shit that was going on here, was some terminally online bullshit.
