(...) Tiberius and Thrasyllus formed a strong bond, but it might have been otherwise.

For if the story told about their first meeting is true, nothing could have been more precariously conceived. Tiberius, it seems, had recently undertaken an earnest search for an astrologer to assist his career. At his hilltop villa overlooking the sea, he would interview prospective candidates on a little verandah set on the edge of the cliff. His questioning was tough, and it is said that if he suspected some fellow or other was merely flattering his prospects, he had him thrown into the sea.

  

Eventually, it was Thrasyllus’s turn to prove his skill. Without hesitation, he predicted that Tiberius would one day rule the Empire in spite of the rivals who then stood in the way. Tiberius then asked him what he could possibly foresee about his own impending fate. Thrasyllus begged leave to consider his own horoscope, then paled and announced: “It seems my own life is right now hanging by a thread.” By that Tiberius knew he had an accurate (if crafty) prognosticator, and stayed his hand. In time the rivals of Tiberius fell away and Augustus proclaimed him his heir.
