# No-Fap and Powerful No-cum Dharma

![[Pasted image 20250419153325.png]]

> 1 - Nofap's broscience has partially converged on many truths known to eternal tradition, great precedence in power gains of sexual meditation. However, it misses two key aspects the ancients knew: semen retention, and SEX!

> 2 - It is only abstinence of ejaculation, and abstinence of lust, which will lead you towards immortality. Your sexual energy must either be cultivated and internalized, or entirely redirected entirely away in a true celibacy. Simple restraint from acting on lust is not enough.

> 3 - Cum is one of Daoist's 3 essential life-energies to be treasured, preserved and cultivated; they believed you only have so many ejaculations in your life before you die. Excessive cooming was considered to result in premature aging and fatigue. Sound familiar?

> 4 - The immediate physical gains of nofap derive from testosterone. The T gains of no fap (and subsequent lift gains) are well known to the experimental bodybuilder sphere. The schedule peaks at Day 7 at about 1.5-2X gains. Do note: this sets a new baseline and stacks indefinitely

> 5 - Testosterone's importance to healthy masculine expression is well-known; it's the basic precondition to power & influence. The second important element is the many zinc in cum, which effects energy levels and the beauty of your skin, hair. Both highly deficient in modern males

> 6 - There very likely is a concerted effort to diminish the virility of men through porn. The unprecedented mass availability of porn is destructive in normalizing unnaturally excessive ejaculation, but also in its insidious psychological damage. Porn should never be consumed.

> 7 - Fetishes are stark example of rewired desire-complexes produced by compulsive porn consumption, prohibiting natural sexual pleasure. Any fetish (including homosexuality) can be cured by extended abstinence. Nofappers call it porn reboot, daoists called it Virgin Boy Training.

> 8 - Must be noted, fetishes are also instilled in depth by trauma. Our desire-complexes are habitual, neural connections that solidify by use over time, like a meandering goat trail turned into roman roads. While any can be reversed, they are self-reinforcing and can dig very deep

> 9 - Female masturbation is far more insidious than male masturbation, BTW. Their orgasm produces massive dose of oxytocin, chemical of bonding & love. Great in sex and why you find pleasuring women always turns them doteful. Yet when they schlick to porn, what are they bonding to?

> 10 - Ejaculation weakens the male spirit. Yet sex is good for it. Sex with a woman is a great hormonal exchange (be advised: one much diminished by the condom), which produces great sexual energy gains. Ejaculation here is sustainable; ejaculation in solitaire is not.

> 11 - To have sex and not ejaculate, however, leads to great power. The sexual energy cultivated is not released, but internalized. This is the real secret of nofap: nocum. If you want real T gains, cum no more than once a day, and fuck no less than 3 times a day. Thank me later.

> 12 - For incels, this program can still be maintained by edging. You must cultivate immense sexual energy, gather it up such that it overflows. Not simply restraint, but lust embraced and gathered to the limit. And yet, we are only halfway there

> (If you're having sex 3 times a day, your cum schedule accelerates. A cycle that takes 7 days for an incel takes 12 hours for someone sexually active. Note: if you're not fucking 3 times a day, you're not really sexually active.)

> 13 - I will unveil the occulted: semen retention does not refer to simply not cumming. It is a technique of ejaculating without release, thus redirecting the cum backwards, internally. Where does it go? Up the spine and into the head. Your sexual energy becomes spiritual power.

> 14 - Semen retention technique: 
> 1. Tightly press left index and thumb to base of penis 
> 2. Pinch the tip closed with right hand 
> 3. Hold breath until climax completes 
> 4. Simultaneously clench the anus 
> 5. Roll eyes upward as if to view the brain 
> 6. Follow climax with extended exhalation

> 15 - Semen retention is safe and valid, and will result in the reabsorption of the hormonal and nutritional and spiritual energy of your sperm into the body. You will feel refreshed and energetic, a far cry from the depletion experienced by coomers.

> 16 - Be advised, snakes have spread a myth about nofap producing prostate cancer. Pay it no heed.

> 17 - Be advised, women feed off your cum. As it makes you more powerful, it makes them more powerful. You must preserve it and only deliver it unto them when deserved (1 out of every 3 sex)

> 18 - "The master's sexual battle is to give a woman an orgasm while avoiding ejaculation, his enemy is womanâ€¦ he should keep himself under control, his mind as detached as if it were floating in the azure sky, his body sunk into nothingness." True Manual of the Perfected Equalization

> 19 - Coolidge Effect, that is, the tendency to get bored of a single partner and seek new ones, is sometimes discussed as a negative side effect accelerated by porn. This is true, but only a problem for women and monogamous societies.

> 20 - If you cannot cultivate full sexual energy through sex multiple times daily, ideally with multiple partners, a path of celibacy might be recommendable. Contrary to popular belief, celibacy is not simply restraint from sex, or from masturbation but restraint from sexuality.

> 21 - In celibacy you would redirect your sexual energy to a procedure of meditation, or prayer. If you continue to experience morning wood or nocturnal emissions, you are still lustful. You are not celibate. If you are tortured by the temptation of women, you are not celibate.

> Be advised, cost of nocturnal emission is worth 100 cooms
