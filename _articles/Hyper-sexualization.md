# Hyper-sexualization

I've been wondering, why does 'Hyper-sexualization' [offend Americans so much?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/flikjd/i_hope_this_is_not_a_controversial_opinion/?rdt=33114)

Maybe it's coz I have Japanese-sensibilities, but I don't even notice it. Americans say that Pyra looks terrible and that her tits are too big. I think her tits look ample. Not too big, not too small. I also think she just looks attractive. I'd rather be looking at an attractive character, than an ugly or generic-looking chracter which is why I don't like Western character designs much, coz the characters always look ugly or generic.

I personaly prefer swimsuit Mythra over Pyra but that's coz Pyra dresses like Brittney Spears and **has some weird hiphop fashion-sense going on.**

**See that's thing, I can actually notice that Pyra is hiphop influenced with them damn lowrider shorts & that thong. These White motherfuckers, they just cry about it being 'TOOO SEXUALIZED!" and these are the same dumbfucks who always brag about how culturally-diverse they are, yet they actually get offended by culturally-diverse characters & foreign cultures.** These white motherfuckers just want everyone to be White & boring like them.

EDIT: I just googled them pants Pyra be wearing and it turns out the first search results actually come USA catalogs advertising Thong booty bitches.

Exactly like what I said, this is an actually a reference to an American subculture but for some reason, Internet seems to be entirely populated by White Virgin Nerds (Who happened to be married, but with a dog as a surrogate child or something.)  

Apparently, American people on internet are actually ignorant of subcultures that came from their own fucking country, AAYYYYY LMAO!

It's weird coz I grew up in the USA during the 80s when ppractically every live-action movie & cartoon had sexual-nudity, and it was still rated pg.  
To now in days, damn near every American is a fucking prude, and then they act like they're better or more evolved than you or some bullshit. I'm just laughing that you're a bunch of fucking faggots who are embarassed by naked bodies. I see the way you motherfuckers look mang, you embodify the term 'soyboi'.

What's really annoying is that Xenoblade 1, Xenosaga trilogy & Xenogears were just as sexualized. They prob just didn't notice (I don't see how you couldn't notice with Saga.) back then coz the older games weren't using a modern Anime art style. They were using the anime art style from their era. It's like these fucktards have intentionally forgotten about Sharla who was in XB1, lol. At least Pyra looks exotic & flashy, she's very American-Hiphop influenced. They even speak in a lot of weird rap slang in the actual game & it's hilarious. Only the English dub though. In Jap, Rex just shouts generic "YEEESSSS!!" chants instead of "FO' SHOOOOO!"  
  
Or maybe that's just my Jap sensibilities talking. Perhaps people like Pyra are normal in USA... LOL! Yeah right. Usa the country where nearly every White & Mexican woman are over 200 pounds of fat.  
Though I shouldn't throw too much shade at Mexicans, since it's not Mexicans complaining about 'sexualization'.  
  
**It's usually just White people (mostly self-proclaimed Liberals.) doing that. That's their way of insulting Japanese culture, and showing off how inferior they think we are.  
  
This is the real reason why I always get offended when I see Westerners (mostly White people) constantly whining about sexuality in video games (100% of those games are made in Japan.). I view it as White people sneakily trying to assert their racist opinions as fact while trying to come off as not racist at all.  
Just look at how only Japanese games get censored on PS4. Metro Exodus didn't get censored and that has strippers & full frontal nudity. Only Devil May Cry 5 got censored and that was just a mere buttcrack.**  

> p.s. these were my main arsenals for missions. Guess they are pretty shit for post-game/coop content

Your loadout is just shit in general lol. You actually beat the game though so it must be working for you.
