# Tips for Online Presence of Mind

> Online socialization on non-anonymous communities has become deeply feminized. Men succumb to embarrassingly petty drama, get burned at slightest slight and nurse the grudge for months, hide behind passive aggression and behind-the-back shadiness. This is not you, reject this!

> Why are we here? Only two true answers, ideally you follow both: (1) the lulz, and (2) self-improvement. Never forget this. The social games are for fun, they're for banter and keks. They are not serious business! The only time for srs business is learning time. Never forget.

> Oh, wait, you're here because you're lonely? Throw out your computer, you have no business here! These who crave socialization are the cancer who have poisoned the network with their maladapted pathology, those who are so desperately invested in their e-reputation. I spit.

> I advise you do opposite of the social-obsessives: ignore  social entirely. Pay NO attention to friendships & circles of people in your network. Ignore entirely their various cliques, their politics & dramas. How liberated you will feel: it is not ignorance, but transcendence.

> Don't hold beefs, don't hold biases. Pick fight with someone today? Treat him same as anyone else tomorrow. One should forget every interaction the moment it concludes, and treat every new interaction entirely afresh. How much rental space is cleared in your mind!

> Look at posts, not people. Let each post stand on its own merit. The author is negligible-- there is no way to assure his sincerity, there is no reason to want to. Assume everything anyone says is a Devil's Advocate: remember, you're here for lulz & elucidation, nothing else!

> Lighten up, and care not if people refuse to. There is no reason to ever be upset online and no reason to care if someone is: their feelings are a problem, and this problem will only ever be solved if you train their emotional tolerance. Friends don't enable friends' weakness!

> Your word must be sovereign: never self-censor for fear of social consequence. Only excuse for self-censorship is (1) avoid a ban, or (2) trolling. If you do it because you worry you might hurt someone's feelings, someone might think less of you, you're only trolling yourself!

> Be neutral! Someone is annoying twat, but he posted dank? Like & RT all the same! Likewise, don't peter out undeserved likes to friends just bc theyre friends; are they worthy friend if they can't earn likes rightfully? Are you good friend if you enable their weak posting? NO!

> I can't stress this enough: if you care about random people online, remember their names and faces and dramas, contextualize all their posts you see in that frame, act and respond in reflection of that knowledge, you lose.

> Do not consider even your own public image, your "brand". Don't think you're beholden to any requirement of consistency, of sincerity. The only thing you must strive for is quality content, that is: good lulz or good knowledge exposition. Nothing else matters. Nothing!

> The only beef that's truly won is the beef that ends in friendship

> Socialization always toxic online, but friendship is not.  Friendship is direct, one on one: brotherly loyalty, noiseless communication, intellectual discussion, freewheeling banter. Masculine opposite of socialization's group manipulations. Those are "friends", not friends.

> There is no good reason to ever discuss doxxable IRL info online, including with your friends, except to spread disinfo. Never. The only value providing your date of birth, city, college, face, etc. has ever been is in doxxing. Vulnerability will not solve your loneliness.

> All social expression online is performed. For many it is subconscious, for the best it is conscious, but for all it is a performance, ESPECIALLY WOMEN. Don't fall for it! They're not depressed, anxious, having breakdown, in tears. They're manipulating for attention. PERIOD.

> Purely social friendships people make online are all feedback loops of increasing manipulation. The ultimate end of this is the online relationship, nothing more than mutual blackmail into interdependency thru progressively shred vulnerability at best. Nothing for you here.

> On the lower end, social friendships online amount to mutual dopamine masturbation and, in DM's, an attention-filler for their IRL loneliness, emotional vampirism, either one-way or oscillating between both equally pathetic parties. There is nothing for you here.

> If anyone's actions online reflect a goal of anything other than (1) lulz, (2) self-improvement; they're toxic.

> Summing up:
1. Ignore the social
2. Treat all posts discreetly
3. Treat yourself sovereign
4. Value only lulz and self-improvement

Practice these Four Values & you will find yourself free of burden, ascended over the network, and mog relentlessly all who confront you.
