# Last of Us 2

LOL LOU 2 was leaked by some crazy fools within the Brazilian localization team, and the plot sounds even worse than Final Faggotry 7 Remake.  

It was so bad, that I didn't believe it at all, until I saw proof. Holy fuck that game looks so boring. That's exactly why I left PSpoor. Every game is just WALK slowly then TALK, and then WALK SLOWLY again. Even Final Fantasy 7 Remake is like that.

An unnaturally muscular 'woman' kills the shit out of Joel with a golf club, and beats the fuck out of Ellie so badly, that her eye pops out.

This is the new protagonist, some Dudechick?  
  
Ellie's girlfriend getting murderized by the Tranny thing.

This is Ellie with her eye popped out of her face. How the fuck do Americans legit love this kind of shit?

It's weird to me, coz they're very anti-sexual depictions of women, but apparently killing the shit out of them is A-ok, LOL!  
  
LOU2 is just a basic revenge plot, but for some reason it just comes off as edgy.

From what I've seen from the leaks, the Tranny looking thing is going way over board and is overkilling the shit out of the LOU1 protagonists and then she replaces them as the main character, :lol: :lol:

What's even the point of that? Weren't the Last of Us Daddy & surrogate daughter meant to be the Gaystation's mascots? I recall when I bought PS3 & PS4, Joel & Ellie were plastered on the cover of some PS boxes. I bought the one with Call of Duty though, coz I actually play COD, and COD can sometimes be... good. In MP. LOL!  
  
At least with Final Faggotry 7 Remake, I can understand why they did the rewrites. They're trying to turn the entire Remake into its own multi-installment franchise.  
**LOU2's plot makes no sense to me, coz they're effectively killing their own franchise by brutally murdering the protags of their own series.**  
  
Man am I glad that I jumped over to Nintendo, where Mythra, Samus & Zelda are our female protags. (LOL they're all White Blonde chicks, but hey mang Nintendo is really good at writing likable wimmin, despite what their background is.)  
On top of that, Xenoblade just has a much deeper plot in general, along with its much deeper combat when compared to LOU.  
  
At least when girls die in a Nintendo game, it doesn't come off as edgy. When a chick dies, it shows to you just how serious the conflict is, coz characters whom you'd expect to have plot-armor, are actually just as expendable as the rest.

Now granted that's exactly what LOU2 is doing, but it has more of a pornographic effect to their deaths.  

When Fiora 'dies' or Haze gets stabbed to death, it's not even shown. Instead what we get is much more effective, we're seeing the reactions from their death and the anguish that the cast feels from witnessing such senseless violence.

Even then, there's layers to those deaths. Haze was meant to be a mercy-killing from the perspective of Nintendo's version of Sephiroth.  
Or in the case of Reyntime, Shulk & Dunban, Fiora's death represented their failures as men.  
They couldn't do jackshit for Fiora, and they feel utterly hopeless about it for a while, but it's then used as a resolve for the rest of their journey.  
In LOU2, you see Abby kill the shit out of the LOU protags, and then she just replaces them. Such shitty writing.  
  
Nintendo does it the other way around, you start off with the villain Edelgard but she dies in every other path except her own and even then, you switch heroes midgame in her own path if you don't fulfill the conditions to continue playing as Edel.

Dimitri actually tried to spare her, but she repaid his kindness, by trying to kill him again LOL!  

With LOU2, it just comes off as if they wanted to be cool & edgy by brutally murdering characters to the point that it looks fetishized.  

That's something that I never understood about these supposed "Strong Female Protag" stories. Why is it that the strong females are always getting their asses kicked & they're bleeding all over the place? I remember the same shit going on with the original Nu-Tomb Raider, where she gets impaled during the beginning of the game, survives it, only to go through more gory ass shit that they survive through.  

It's weird to me, coz I sure as hell never saw Ripley from Alien doing any of that.  
Hell, Nintendo's Samus Aran & Mythra/Pyra (Mythra was probably what Ripley was like as a teen or college-aged adult, lol.) come off more like proper Ripley-tributes than what ever the hell this gory mess is that Westerners seem to love so much.  

For the record, this is what muscular women naturally look like.

Notice how her body actually looks feminine, and not a fridge. The Fridge-body is the type of physique that a man normally gets if they're under 6 ft tall but pack on about 290 pounds of muscle. Even 5'10/5'9 (He's one of those 176cm types.) Mike Tyson really only had 215 pounds of muscle at his peak. Rhyno from WWE fits the Fridge stereotype to a tee.  
That Woman/Man-thing in LOU2 was either a man who became a woman, or they've been eating some zombie-apocalypse steroids and supplemented their diet off of hooman meat or something, lol.

A lot of the Nerdlords who write and are fans of this shit, don't seem to understand how you get a big manly body. Here's the secret, you need girth, eat motherfucker, Eat! You gotta put some fat on your bones and then you shape it.
