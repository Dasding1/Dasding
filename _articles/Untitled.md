> 0 - Well known that modern relationships experiencing dramatic failure to sustain themselves in the long-term. The reason is densely layered, but this thread will exclusively focus on the fundamental physical conditions, that is: the hormonal factors of love, and their disruption.

> 1 - Two key aspects to make sex solidify a relationship, and both are greatly hampered today: the female orgasm, and the exchange of sexual fluid. We'll start with the former: many women report never experiencing orgasm with a partner, only through masturbation. This is a crisis.

> 2 - Oxytocin is the hormone to know. It's produced when you cuddle, when you stare into each other's eyes. It produces the feeling of love, of a fuzzy stomach, a longing heart. And it induces bonding; it's generated in pregnancy, on breastfeedingâ€”but most heavily on female orgasm.

> 3 - A novel, unspoken epidemic of modernity is that of female masturbation. Women subject themselves to psychic distortion by orgasming to, and thus inducing bonding with, virtualities: porn, their imaginations, themselves. It damagers natural attraction.

> 4 - Female masturbation is intensive, & usually targets specifically the clitoris. This dulls clitoral sensitivity, making it harder for the man to pleasure her, and produces a self-fetishization which targets the specifically efficient attraction point over a holistic experience.

> 5 - Overmasturbatory men might have noted similar: that women cannot pleasure them as efficiently as they pleasure themselves, and a dulling of their sensation from their aggressive masturbation. But masturbation is far insidious in women, remolding their sensitive psyches totally

> 6 - The blame is often on male masturbation, and the psychological effects of porn & the dulling of sexual pleasure. This is bad and worth cutting, but ultimately a distraction. More important is it teaches men to think of sex as masturbation, an act purely aimed at ejaculation.

> 7 - A relationship without female orgasm is a failed relationship. Man's goal in sex is always her orgasm, the oxytocin it produces results in immediate & obvious love, bonding & servility: it instills wifeliness. This secret has been lost to modern coomer.

> 8 - As female masturbation is the great bane of modern women, circumcision is the great bane of modern man. They hate to hear it, but circumcision makes men suffer much greater difficulty in pleasuring a woman to orgasm.

> 9  - Circumcision removes 50% of the gland's nerve endings, greatly damaging the man's ability to feel both pleasure and sensitivity to the physical dimensions of female body. Further, it exposes the head of the penis: what should be soft is roughened through repeated abrasions

> 10 - Both dulling factors not only limit male pleasure, forcing him towards crude roughness, but also cause inability to intimately sense physical dimensions of the female body, insensitivity to contractions & tensing which communicate pleasure points. Both are left unpleasured.

> 11 - Ultimately, circumcised men resort to lubricant. This brings me to my next point: fluid transfer. The use of lubricant greatly dilutes the essential sexual fluid transfer that occurs in intercourse, in a feedback loop of increasing virility and fertility signals.

> 12 - Sexual fluid transfer is most important for the man. Woman's vaginal secretions, largely prolactin, received by the man induces testosterone production, increases male fertility, and oxytocin in himself. Precum, in return, nourishes the womb and induces prolactin production.

> 13 - Without fluid transfer, man produces limited oxytocin, bonding weakly to his partner. When you use a condom, you block all fluid transfer. This is the third major element damaging modern sexuality after male circumcision and female masturbation.

> 14 - Truly, for a man, sex with a condom is not sex at all. Men who have never fornicated without "protection" may still be considered virgins.

> 15 - Birth control is final element of broken relationships. It tricks the body into thinking your pregnant, causing many endocrine disruptions but most important is female pheromonal attraction changes during pregnancy: going on/off the pill causes breakups & cheating, every time

> 16 - A final note, much work has been done to obscure the fact you may finish inside a woman without reproductive consequence during week of her period. A myth has even been perpetuated there is still chance of pregnancy. Impossible: if she's bleeding, her uterus lining is shed.

> 17 - Finishing inside has a very deep effect, one not well understood but evidenced in spades. The hormonal energy of your sperm absorbs into her body and instills a well-being and youthfulness; your DNA microchimerizes to combine with her, her mind becomes sublimated into yours.

> 18 - They've done much to hide this from the youth. Not taught in sex ed, and obtusely named "Fertility Awareness Method". A nonsensical term: all women know intimately their own cycle, and any man that doesn't know his partner's? Doesn't know his partner.
