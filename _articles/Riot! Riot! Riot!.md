_—Exaclty._

> At the flea market in Vienna I saw young people from Ukraine or Romania who, because of the cold, simply put layers on top of layers and thus created their own volumes

Unfamiliarity is a threat.

but still a threat to wear those now familiar trench coats shortly after the Trench Coat Mafia incident.

### Richey Edwards and Manic Street Preachers

“You’re not a real punk!” someone had the gall to yell at Richey Edwards. 

“What the fuck? I am punk, I’m punk..for real.. see?” (_twisted expression_)

A truly distinguished specimen.

All other Street Preachers patches are newspaper clippings of Richey's disappearance and presumed death.

### David Bowie

Poster for the movie The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which David Bowie played a decadent artist who spirals into drug addiction. Bowie didn't need to use much of his talent since he was irl having a bad time with cocaine.

### Christiane F

![[Pasted image 20250214182427.png]]

Movie about a 13-year-old girl who is obsessed with David Bowie and ends up becoming addicted to heroin and falling into a self-destructive spiral. Much like Bowie himself, the actress was “playing herself” since she and many other actors in the movie were in fact addicted to heroin at the time it was filmed.

Almost all the patches orbit around the theme of teenage rebellion and self-sacrifice for the sake of art.
