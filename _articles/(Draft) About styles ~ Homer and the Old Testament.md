# (Draft) About styles ~ Homer and the Old Testament

One characteristic trait of Homer's poems, and perhaps even of greek epics in general, is a preference for absolute clarity in the subjects they address. Every object and character is meticulously contextualized, even if it comes at the expense of the narrative's dramatic voltage.

He's not afraid to make contextualizing digressions even near the climax. *So you want to see the battle between Achilles and Hector? Okay, but first let's listen to a long speech by each of them. Then what about pausing the narrative amidst the war to delve into detailed descriptions of a shield or the lineage of a soldier who unexpectedly enters the tale?*

And yet this style works! 

Probably because of the compelling power description holds in each of these moments. All digressions are self-sustaining. They are worth their own short story.

It's as if Homer regards the present tense as absolute. Unlike the more conventional style, which selectively reveals elements of the past relevant to the main narrative, Homer meticulously details every aspect of these memories for several pages, until they usurp the primary narrative.

A good example of this Homeric "absolute present tense" happens when Achilles assigns Patroclus as sentinel and messenger. Once the narrative shifts its focus to Patroclus, Achilles completely fades from us, leaving hardly any "indirect" indication of his presence, despite being the initial instigator of Patroclus' actions.

This preference for the present tense is precisely what allows a profound aestheticization of every detail, transforming even the most mundane events into sumptuously described scenes worthy of an Olympian battle. It's not an exaggeration to suggest that a meticulously crafted audiovisual adaptation of the Homeric poems, faithfully adhering to their fundamental structure, would resemble something between the visual grandeur of *Vampire Hunter D* (1999) and the comforting simplicity of *K-On* (2009).

On the contrasting end we find the Semitic style, particularly evident in the Old Testament. Consider the binding of Isaac. It begins with God's sudden appearance and His call to Abraham, who obediently replies with a humble "Behold me".

Questions arise: what does this God look like? From where does He speak? Where Abraham is, and what does he wear? What is the setting, the time of day? Homer might have delved into these details, but the Bible remains conspicuously silent on such matters.

Every adjective serves the explicit purpose of showcasing Abraham's readiness and obedience. Take for example the passage when God says to “take Isaac, thine only son, whom thou lovest”. This description only tells us something about Isaac in relation to his father, still we don't know anything about Isaac himself: if he's tall, intelligent, cheerful, nothing; but only that he is *the beloved* son of Abraham. In other words, this characterization only serves to underline the magnitude of the sacrifice Abraham would have to make. 

After that, the entire world fades away, leaving only the distance between our characters and the mission they must accomplish as the focal point of the story.

Abraham's journey from point A to point B is depicted with scant details about the landscape, the characters, or even his son or Abraham himself. This way the narrative form mirrors Abraham's monotheistic stance, as he appears focused solely on his path ahead, never looking left or right, unwaveringly committed to the mission bestowed upon him by an ineffable God who appears out of nowhere and gives orders without explanation. The obliteration of individual will in favor of the divine mission also sets the tone for the dialogues: in contrast to the Greek style, where characters express their emotions openly through speeches, Abraham speaks solely to conceal his true sentiments. Everything is implied, painfully kept inside his heart. God gives his command in direct discourse, but even He leaves his motives unexpressed. 

Despite their seemingly straightforward characterizations, biblical figures possess a depth and psychological richness surpassing those of Homer's heroes. Achilles lives every day as if it were his first: his emotions are as strong as they are simple, being expressed instantly and completely as soon as circumstances meet him. Abraham, on the other hand, despite not expressing anything at that particular moment, carries a weight **through** memory. His actions stem from God's promise and past blessings. Every new mission places him on a threshold between rebellion and hope. All his answers, simple and laconic as they may be, announce yet another victory for Abraham's faith in the God of Jeshurun.

While in the Homeric epic the narrative is excessively illuminated with epithets, the semitic epic is sacredly minimalist.

### The legendary, historical and prophetic styles.

Another distinctive aspect of the Semitic style is its implicit assertion to serve as the interpretive cornerstone of the entire cosmos. While Homeric poems often invite escapism, showing less concern for the factual basis of the events narrated, the Old Testament not only demands that the reader believe in the truth of each specific event but also in a comprehensive and unified worldview. It doesn't just seek truth regarding the facts but the very structure of reality.  

This legendary approach is characterized by directness and simplicity; the narrative flows smoothly, free from conflicting information or deep ambiguities, as if the entire world existed solely to tell that particular story. Conversely, the historical narrative is rife with ambiguities, contradictions within characters, and conflicts within their surroundings, alongside uncertain and conflicting information, and many references peripheral to the narrative's core, such as the geographical locations of certain cities or the everyday life of the region. In this style, the world appears entirely indifferent to the story being told, leading to constant intersections with other narratives entirely unrelated to its main purpose. In a sense, the "characters" in the historical style are continuously striving to assert their will within an impartial or antagonistic milieu.

Initially, distinguishing between these two styles is quite straightforward, but the Old Testament tends to transition between them in subtle ways. Consider, for instance, the story of King David: while the narrator discusses the political turmoil of his era, the narrative seamlessly adopts a historical style, replete with conflicts, ambiguities, and unreliable information. Yet, it swiftly transitions to a seemingly undefined setting, which, from the sparse descriptions, could be any location, and begins recounting a battle between a monstrous, almost mythical giant and a significantly weaker boy[^1] . The complexities of the world momentarily seem to fade, and the narrative progresses from start to finish with the precision of an arrow, as if the entire world had conspired to ensure that the events between David and Goliath unfolded exactly as depicted.

[^1]: Regulus's tale stands out as a prime example of the seamless blend between legendary storytelling and historical narrative.

Finally, closing the Semitic stylistic trifecta are the prophecies—or the prophetic “style”. As mentioned earlier, the Old Testament requires a complete transformation from the reader. Following this, the expectation is to interpret all of existence using the Old Testament as a reference and fundamental basis. With such universal aspirations, there arises the necessity for interpretations that will similarly adapt the narrative of the Pentateuch for societies vastly distant in both time and space from the Israelites. 

Undoubtedly, this is the most expansive style, tracing back from the biblical narrative, through the interpretations of the prophets who revealed divine insights into past events, extending to the legendary tales of the Matter of Britain, and onward to the synthesized myths of George MacDonald and J.R.R. Tolkien.

Numerous attempts, among many others, aimed to adapt Semitic stories to vastly different contexts. This rejuvenation is crucial to prevent a situation akin to Hamlet's disconnect with Hecuba[^2] , where the cultural style and emotional resonance of a people become so remote that relating to them feels artificial and strained.

[^2]: _"What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,_ _That he should weep for her?"_

Failing to adapt the Semitic stories to different contexts over time, while preserving their core meaning, could slowly bring about the decline of the Abrahamic religions from catalepsy.
