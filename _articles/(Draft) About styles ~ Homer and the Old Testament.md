# (Draft) About styles ~ Homer and the Old Testament

One characteristic trait of Homer's poems, and perhaps even of greek epics in general, is a preference for absolute clarity in the subjects they address. Every object and character is meticulously contextualized, even if it comes at the expense of the narrative's dramatic voltage.

He's not afraid to make contextualizing digressions even in the most tense moments of the story (such as before battles). *So you want to see the battle between Achilles and Hector? Okay, but first let's listen to a long speech by each of them. Then what about pausing the narrative amidst the war to delve into detailed descriptions of a shield or the lineage of a soldier who unexpectedly enters the tale?*

And yet this style works! 

Probably because of the compelling power of description within each of these moments. All digressions are self-sustaining. They are worth their own short story.

It's as if Homer regards the present as absolute. Unlike the more conventional style, which selectively reveals elements of the past relevant to the main narrative, Homer meticulously details every aspect of these memories for several pages, until they usurp the primary narrative.

On the contrasting end, we find the Semitic style, particularly evident in the Old Testament. Consider the story of the binding of Isaac. It kicks off with God's sudden appearance and His call to Abraham, who obediently replies with a humble "Behold me".

Questions arise: what does this God look like? From where does He speak? Where is Abraham situated, and what attire does he wear? What is the setting, the time of day? Homer might have delved into these details, but the Bible remains conspicuously silent on such matters.

Every adjective serves the explicit purpose of showcasing Abraham's readiness and obedience to this ineffable God (as when He says “Take Isaac, thine only son, whom thou lovest” underscoring the magnitude of the sacrifice Abraham would have to make). Abraham's journey from point A to point B is depicted with scant details about the landscape, the characters, or even Abraham himself and his son. This way the narrative form mirrors Abraham's monotheistic stance, as he appears focused solely on his path ahead, never looking left or right, unwaveringly committed to the mission bestowed upon him.

Unlike the Greek style, where the dialogues serve to fully externalize the feelings of the characters, the exact opposite occurs here: Abraham talks to hide his feelings. Everything is implied, painfully kept inside the characters' hearts.

While in the Homeric epic everything is excessively illuminated with epithets, the biblical epic is sacredly minimalist.
