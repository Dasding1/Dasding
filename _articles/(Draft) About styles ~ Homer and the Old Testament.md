# (Draft) About styles ~ Homer and the Old Testament

One characteristic trait of Homer's poems, and perhaps even of greek epics in general, is a preference for absolute clarity in the subjects they address. Every object and character is meticulously contextualized, even if it comes at the expense of the narrative's dramatic voltage.

He's not afraid to make contextualizing digressions even in the most tense moments of the story (such as before battles). *So you want to see the battle between Achilles and Hector? Okay, but first let's listen to a long speech by each of them. Then what about pausing the narrative amidst the war to delve into detailed descriptions of a shield or the lineage of a soldier who unexpectedly enters the tale?*

And yet this style works! 

Probably because of the compelling power of description within each of these moments. All digressions are self-sustaining. They are worth their own short story.

It's as if Homer regards the present as absolute. Unlike the more conventional style, which selectively reveals elements of the past relevant to the main narrative, Homer meticulously details every aspect of these memories for several pages, until they usurp the primary narrative.

On the contrasting end we find the Semitic style, particularly evident in the Old Testament. Consider the story of the binding of Isaac. It begins with God's sudden appearance and His call to Abraham, who obediently replies with a humble "Behold me".

Questions arise: what does this God look like? From where does He speak? Where is Abraham situated, and what attire does he wear? What is the setting, the time of day? Homer might have delved into these details, but the Bible remains conspicuously silent on such matters.

Every adjective serves the explicit purpose of showcasing Abraham's readiness and obedience. Take for example the passage when God says to “take Isaac, thine only son, whom thou lovest”. This description only tells us something about Isaac in relation to his father, still we don't know anything about Isaac himself: if he's tall, intelligent, cheerful, nothing; but only that he is *the beloved* son of Abraham. In other words, this characterization only serves to underline the magnitude of the sacrifice Abraham would have to make. 

After that, the entire world fades away, leaving only the distance between our characters and the mission they must accomplish as the focal point of the story.

Abraham's journey from point A to point B is depicted with scant details about the landscape, the characters, or even his son or Abraham himself. This way the narrative form mirrors Abraham's monotheistic stance, as he appears focused solely on his path ahead, never looking left or right, unwaveringly committed to the mission bestowed upon him by an ineffable God who appears out of nowhere and gives orders without justifying them. This obliteration of individual will in favor of the divine mission also sets the tone for the dialogues: unlike the Greek style, where the characters completely externalize their feelings through speeches, Abraham talks only to hide his feelings. Everything is implied, painfully kept inside his heart. God gives his command in direct discourse, but even He leaves his motives unexpressed. 

Despite their seemingly straightforward characterizations, the biblical figures possess a depth and psychological richness surpassing those of Homer's heroes. Achilles lives every day as if it were his first: his emotions are as strong as they are simple, being expressed instantly and completely as soon as circumstances meet him. Abraham, on the other hand, despite not expressing anything at that particular moment, carries a weight **through** memory. His actions stem from God's promise and past blessings. Every new mission places him on a threshold between rebellion and hope. All his answers, simple and laconic as they may be, announce yet another victory for Abraham's faith in the God of Jeshurun.

While in the Homeric epic the narrative is excessively illuminated with epithets, the biblical epic is sacredly minimalist.
