# Rave Culture and Religion


> Dance parties have transmuted the role that organised religion once had to lift us onto the sacramental and supramental plane. 
> 
> —Ray Castle, in ENRG 2001:169.

> From African priests to Korean shamans, there was and still is the belief that dance and music can open communication with intangible powers and produce tangible benefits for the communities involved: selfknowledge; fuller understanding of the natural world; good health; and a sense of belonging to a supportive group in an often dark and hostile but ultimately understandable universe. 
> 
> Apollo 2001: issue 34.

> David danced and sang before God and we’re just bringing it back with a funkier beat.
> 
> On the other side of nihilism new formations are emerging, this time exploiting the faultlines in the cultural landscape by slipping through the gaps. Ecstatic dance offers one such line of flight. Dance culture exploits the power of music to build a future on the desolate terrain of the present. 
> 
> —Hemment 1996:26

> A kinaesthetic maelstrom inflected by diverse sonic currents

> Throughout the 1990s rave grew prevalent in the experience of urban youth as vast numbers attached primary significance to raving. With the combined stimulus of electronic musics, psychotropic lighting, chemical alterants and all-night dancing, young novices and experienced habitués transcended the mundane in converted warehouses, wilderness areas, beaches, deserts and streets. Decked out in esoteric accessories, ultra violet (UV)-reactive clothing, personalized icons and an array of assimilated ‘religious’ glossolalia. >

> Rudolf Otto named the ‘mysterium tremendum’, the religious experience which he indicated ‘may burst in sudden eruption up from the depths of the soul with spasms and convulsions, or lead to the strongest excitements, to intoxicated frenzy, to transport, and to ecstasy’ (1959:27); P21

> Victor Turner called the realm of the ‘subjunctive mood’—a world of ‘wish, desire, possibility, or hypothesis’ (Turner 1982:83); P22

> An ‘oceanic experience’ (Malbon 1999) or a kind of prolonged youth suicide? Does post-rave more closely approximate a church, Disney World, or a ‘detention camp for youth’ (Reynolds 1998:424)? P23
