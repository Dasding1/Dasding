# Rave Culture and Religion


> Dance parties have transmuted the role that organised religion once had to lift us onto the sacramental and supramental plane. 
> 
> —Ray Castle, in ENRG 2001:169.

> From African priests to Korean shamans, there was and still is the belief that dance and music can open communication with intangible powers and produce tangible benefits for the communities involved: selfknowledge; fuller understanding of the natural world; good health; and a sense of belonging to a supportive group in an often dark and hostile but ultimately understandable universe. 
> 
> Apollo 2001: issue 34.

> David danced and sang before God and we’re just bringing it back with a funkier beat.
> 
> On the other side of nihilism new formations are emerging, this time exploiting the faultlines in the cultural landscape by slipping through the gaps. Ecstatic dance offers one such line of flight. Dance culture exploits the power of music to build a future on the desolate terrain of the present. 
> 
> —Hemment 1996:26

> A kinaesthetic maelstrom inflected by diverse sonic currents

> Throughout the 1990s rave grew prevalent in the experience of urban youth as vast numbers attached primary significance to raving. With the combined stimulus of electronic musics, psychotropic lighting, chemical alterants and all-night dancing, young novices and experienced habitués transcended the mundane in converted warehouses, wilderness areas, beaches, deserts and streets. Decked out in esoteric accessories, ultra violet (UV)-reactive clothing, personalized icons and an array of assimilated ‘religious’ glossolalia. >

> Rudolf Otto named the ‘mysterium tremendum’, the religious experience which he indicated ‘may burst in sudden eruption up from the depths of the soul with spasms and convulsions, or lead to the strongest excitements, to intoxicated frenzy, to transport, and to ecstasy’ (1959:27); P21

> Victor Turner called the realm of the ‘subjunctive mood’—a world of ‘wish, desire, possibility, or hypothesis’ (Turner 1982:83); P22

> An ‘oceanic experience’ (Malbon 1999) or a kind of prolonged youth suicide? Does post-rave more closely approximate a church, Disney World, or a ‘detention camp for youth’ (Reynolds 1998:424)? P23

> The insurrectionary ‘noise’ or chaos of TAZs, uprisings, refusals and epiphanies…will release a hundred blooming flowers, a thousand, a million memes of resistance, of difference, of non-ordinary consciousness—the will to power as ‘strangeness’. (Bey 1995); P33

> Rave demonstrates signs of that which Bozeman calls a **‘technological millenarianism’** pervading popular culture which, in nations like the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada and Australia, boils down to a faith in technological innovation to ‘bring forth a better future beginning here and now’ (1997:155).; P33

> The rave ‘techgnosis’ manifests as a kind of ‘occult mechanics’ capable of liberating the self through esoteric gnosis: ‘a mystical breakthrough of total liberation, an influx of knowing oneself to be part of the genuine godhead, of knowing oneself to be free’ (Davis 1998:94); P35

> I suggest that the flame gutters yet glows in techno-rave, which is often felt to communicate, or potentiate, a profound sense of freedom, of recognition, often glossed as ‘the gnosis’; P35

> Ekstasis has often been considered to rupture gender-identity boundaries by liberating, or ‘disarticulating’, dominant feminine/ masculine subjectivities (Gilbert and Pearson 1999:104–5; see also Pini 2001), or more broadly, attending to Deleuze and Guattari’s ‘micropolitics of desire’, through a sensuous intervention in the regulation of desire (Hemment 1996:26–7; Jordan 1995)—processes which can be tracked through house music’s gay underground (see Apollo 2001) to various post-rave trajectories; P35

> Remember 2001 A Space Odyssey? When a tribe of Neanderthals woke up to the giant monolith planted in their midst? Raves remind me a lot of that scene. When I watch a group of sweaty dancers rest their heads on the metallic grill of a giant, black speaker and attach their trembling chests to the gaping mouth of a pulsating woofer, I instantly remember the same ape, 2 million years ago, touching, sniffing and kissing the unfamiliar and fascinating dark object; (Ramy 1999) (P35)

>rave is made synonymous with the black stone, the ‘prima materia’ or Philosopher’s Stone which, in alchemical lore, is capable of transmuting humankind and which, according to interpretation (see Weidner 2000), inspired Stanley Kubrick’s black monolith in 2001; P36

Rave Manifesto:

**> ‘in the heat, dampness, and darkness’ of the womb-like party, we came to accept that we are all equal. Not only to the darkness, and to ourselves, but to the very music slamming into us and passing through our souls: we are all equal. And somewhere around 35Hz we could feel the hand of God at our backs, pushing us forward, pushing us to push ourselves to strengthen our minds, our bodies, and our spirits. Pushing us to turn to the person beside us to join hands and uplift them by sharing the uncontrollable joy we felt from creating this magical bubble that can, for one evening, protect us from the horrors, atrocities, and pollution of the outside world. It is in that very instant, with these initial realizations that each of us was truly born.'**

> It is also apparent that, if rave speaks, if it reveals information, then it often speaks in tongues evincing bricolage à la carte (Possamai 2002:203), an effusion consistent with its syncretic digestion of existing symbol systems, philosophies and theologies; P36

> Guiding initiates along new paths of self-discovery, DJs are often heralded, or self-identify, as shamanic (Hutson 1999), a status earlier conferred upon disco and house legends like Larry Levan and Frankie Knuckles, or are perhaps more accurately master drummers who, as in Santeria, keep the beat for the dancers while always remaining sober, never possessed (Twist 1999:107). P38

> MDMA is also thought comparable to Nepethe—the mythic drink of the ancient Greek Gods which induced a ‘state of transcendent ecstasy which temporarily dispels our psychic darkness, filling us with the light that heals’ (Eisner 1994:137); P40
