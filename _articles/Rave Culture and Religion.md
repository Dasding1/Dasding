# Rave Culture and Religion


> Dance parties have transmuted the role that organised religion once had to lift us onto the sacramental and supramental plane. 
> 
> —Ray Castle, in ENRG 2001:169.

> From African priests to Korean shamans, there was and still is the belief that dance and music can open communication with intangible powers and produce tangible benefits for the communities involved: selfknowledge; fuller understanding of the natural world; good health; and a sense of belonging to a supportive group in an often dark and hostile but ultimately understandable universe.

> Apollo 2001: issue 34.

> David danced and sang before God and we’re just bringing it back with a funkier beat.
> 
> On the other side of nihilism new formations are emerging, this time exploiting the faultlines in the cultural landscape by slipping through the gaps. Ecstatic dance offers one such line of flight. Dance culture exploits the power of music to build a future on the desolate terrain of the present.
