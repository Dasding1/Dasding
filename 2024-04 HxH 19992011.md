#  2024-04: HxH 1999/2011
![[4738.jpg]]


1. Your brain quickly pegs 2011 adaptation as phony since the saturated colors don't resemble those you'd see in real life;
2. Overall 1999 color palette is closer to each other; mostly greens with some greyish and yellowish hues;
3. Gon more easily stands out because he takes up half the screen and his skin is more easily an outlier in the frame's palette;
4. 1999 also nails the gradation of colors and shades, especially noticeable in Gon's hat, while 2011 just sticks the protagonist in that same old plain green from head to toe;
5. There's also more care taken with the empty spaces: in the first frame, the sky reinforces the wild and swampy atmosphere, while in the second it's just a hideously generic stock blue that makes you wonder if the animators were phoning it in.
